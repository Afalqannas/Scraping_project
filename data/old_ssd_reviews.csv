Overall Review:
            I've been using Samsung electronics for years and have never been disappointed until now, and I'm very familiar with Samsung ssd's as well I currently have an 830 in my old alienware, but I decided to update to the new at the time V-nand in my laptop and replace the HDD in my wife's laptop. replacing her's went smooth it showed up in the bios and was able to install a clean copy of windows. however the second one for me was absolutely dead, I've tried to connect internally and with every usb port on both my laptop and her's and my buddies desktop and nothing, it doesn't appear in bios or device manager so be warned. its too late for RMA because I've been too busy to post a review or even contact anyone, I purchased both in 2017 and its now the end of April 2019 and that's on me.

9,Good SSD for Sata,"
Overall Review:
            I bought this for to replace a WD 1.5TB black HDD used to hold games. The reason behind moving my game storage from a HDD to an SSD was to decrease game load times. The 2nd reason was 1TB SSD’s are finally hitting a good price point. This review is late in coming I have owned this SSD for 2 years now. I ran CrysalDiskMark to perform the testing. Do to the speed of the drive I was not able to test its potential “real” data transfer speed. (as a note to the speed tests I am not sure why the newer 850 is slower than my older one) Samsung 850 EVO 1TB: Read 403 MB/s, Write 411 MB/s  (2017 model firmware EMT03B6Q)For ComparisonSamsung 860 Evo 256GB : Read 542 MB/s, Write 509 MB/s  (new drive in another computer)Samsung 850 Pro 512GB: Read 553 MB/s, Write 502 MB/s (2014 model firmware EXM04B6Q)Samsung 850 Evo 1TB:  Read 555 MB/s, Write 508 MB/s  (2014 Model firmware EMT02B6Q)WD Black NVMe 500GB: Read 3414 MB/s, Write 2543 MB/sWD Red 3TB WDEFRX: Read 135 MB/s, Write 128 MB/sEven though the newer drive is “slow” I am still happy with its performance. It is very close to the max speed of a sata III (6gbps) interface. I have the 2 Evo’s for my game libraries and the Pro for my OS. The EVO series in has a shorter expected life than the Pro series (fewer writes) which is why I am using it for my game library. I expect to only install and not uninstall games regularly, while the OS drives tend to do more writes. I am also using a standard HDD the WD Red 3tb for my mass storage like pictures, docs, and music.

Cons:
                RMA process if it needs to be returned has been reported as being  very difficult.  Therefore, I would consider paying a little more for the INTEL ssd and avoid that problem  later.  Anyone can sell you any thing , but service after the sale is everything.   SAMSUNG is the fastest , but INTEL is more reliable and does not have the RMA / return issue.  SAMSUNG is the best as long as it does not fail to work. I do have five  SAMSUNG drives ranging from 1 month to 2 years old, and no problems with any one of them yet. I now feel comfortable with their quality and will purchase more of them in the future.

Overall Review:
            If you were planning on getting an SSD don't get anything less than a Samsung 850 EVO.In Rust (Steam game) My load times to load into a server went from 3.18 Minutes/sec on the mentioned HDD above to literally 1 Minute on the 850 EVO.Saved me between 15-23 seconds on BOOT Up as well.Take my word, if you never owned an SSD like me and this is your first time there are 2 things I highly suggest you do and you won't regret.#1 Don't buy the 250GB Version, skip that and don't get anything smaller than the 500GB Version. My first SSD and I LOVE it!! I bought the 250GB Version and when I saw how fast it was I returned it for the 500GB Version 2 days after.#2 Don't buy anything other than a Samsung SSD, they are some of the best SSD's in the market. When compared and comparing Samsung 850 EVO and Other Samsung's SSD to other brands the 850 Supersedes the other SSD brands by at least 12-15% Minimum.I thought SSD's were just HYPE but I was wrong until I tried it, no regrets on my Purchase. Not sponsored just a normal Gamer on a budget. i7 6700K, GTX 970.

Overall Review:
            2 Quick and very important rules, you will thank me for it.#1 Don't cheap out and buy anything less than a 500GB SSD #2 Do not buy any other SSD other than the EVO serier 850 and up. Trust me if you look on reviews online the 850 EVO outperforms every other SSD on its category by at least a minimum of 10-12% if not more.My only regret? not buying the 500gb version instead of the 250GB. Bottom line, yes its a bit expensive, but only slightly compared to the boost your computer gets. Compared to my WD Black 2TB 7200RPM HDD this thing is lighting fast. No regrets on my purchase. Can't believe I waited to almost 2019 to believe all the hype. Loving it.

38,Worth the money if...,"
Overall Review:
            I've been very happy with the ones I put in my computer and the ones I use for backups. While HDDs are far more cost effective, their weight and size were creating problems for my old carcass. Not having to lug around and find room for a bunch of backup HDDs made the cost worthwhile for me (never mind that I'll be eating mustard sandwiches--without the bread--for a long time). Not everyone will be able to justify that expense. The increased speed when moving large amounts of data was a happy bonus for me.However, Samsung has since replaced the 850 series with the 860s. I recommend them over the 850s for lower price rather than buying new 850s. There would be no benefit to replacing perfectly good 850s with 860s, though.

Pros:
                Small size, light weight, no moving parts to wear out or break, impact resistant, low power consumption, generates little heat, large capacity, and greater speed.

Pros:
                Extremely simple set-up, comes with a cable that makes it absurdly easy to clone your C drive onto this to make this your boot drive, hardy and running well. I have one of these in each of 3 desktops and 1 laptop for 2+ years and none dead yet. My company also installed them as boot drives in each of our dozen or so other work PCs 3 years ago, with no issues.
            ","
Cons:
                Cloning instructions are a little confusing, says that any info not cloned will be wiped from the source drive, which is wrong (so I wasted time backing up ~ 500 gigs of data to another drive that was over what I wanted on the boot drive), and it does not come with a drive tray, so can be a pain in the rear to strap into place in the case, or you have to leave it loose.

Overall Review:
            I highly recommend this. Money wise, this is the best upgrade you can make on your computer if you do a bit of everything on it. Personally I do everything, from social media sites to watching movies to video games. Mostly video games. If you hate loading times as much as me, get this. If you hate low FPS and like good graphics, get a GPU first, then this. Also, keep in mind SSD's are very sturdy and highly unlikely to break down or be defective. Unlike many Graphics cards which have a much higher chance of having problems later down the road or being defective. A bit off topic here, but I highly recommend the Nividia Geforce GTX 960. It runs cool, it is sturdy, and it is well worth the money. Will play anything you throw at it on ultra if you have the processor to keep it from bottlenecking.
        ","
Pros:
                It will download on my old stock mobo at 400 mb's per second. I went from waiting sometimes 2 minutes for stuff to load all the way to waiting at most 12 seconds. After I installed my new Graphics card, the longest I wait now is 7 seconds. It takes 10 seconds to restart my computer, 5 seconds to boot it, 3 seconds to load GTA 5 (About 12 seconds before I installed my Nivida, GeForce GTX 960) and 4 seconds to load Fallout 4 on medium graphics settings, and 7 seconds on max settings. That should give you a general idea of how fast this bad boy is. Keep in mind, load times are affected mainly by SSD however GPU. CPU, and RAM also play a role in this. So times are subject to change depending on system hardware.EDIT: Over 1 year later and this bad boy is still working like new, only a few bad sectors (Dont freak out this is normal.) but at the rate its going, it should last around 20 years for me. Literally. SSDs last nearly as long as RAM if not longer.

Overall Review:
            I had to disconnect and reconnect the drive a few times when trying to find a good mounting position/cable management. The connection board (not the connections themselves if that makes sense) feel a bit creaky/loose. I'm not concerned now that it's mounted, but it was a bit nerve-racking as I did fear it might break off. Never experienced this before. That aside, the Samsung EVO series is fantastic. Tons of reviews and benchmarks out there, so not much else for me to add. Although you pay a bit of a premium for Samsung products, for a few extra bucks, it's well worth the piece of mind that I'm getting a quality product. I recommend these drives to all my friends & customers -  you can't go wrong.

Overall Review:
            I bought this for to replace a WD 1.5TB black HDD used to hold games. The reason behind moving my game storage from a HDD to an SSD was to decrease game load times. The 2nd reason was 1TB SSD’s are finally hitting a good price point. This review is late in coming I have owned this SSD for 2 years now. I ran CrysalDiskMark to perform the testing. Do to the speed of the drive I was not able to test its potential “real” data transfer speed.

It is very close to the max speed of a sata III (6gbps) interface. I have the 2 Evo’s for my game libraries and the Pro for my OS. The EVO series in has a shorter expected life than the Pro series (fewer writes) which is why I am using it for my game library. I expect to only install and not uninstall games regularly, while the OS drives tend to do more writes. I am also using a standard HDD the WD Red 3tb for my mass storage like pictures, docs, and music.

Cons:
                RMA process if it needs to be returned has been reported as being  very difficult.  Therefore, I would consider paying a little more for the INTEL ssd and avoid that problem  later.  Anyone can sell you any thing , but service after the sale is everything.   SAMSUNG is the fastest , but INTEL is more reliable and does not have the RMA / return issue.  SAMSUNG is the best as long as it does not fail to work. I do have five  SAMSUNG drives ranging from 1 month to 2 years old, and no problems with any one of them yet. I now feel comfortable with their quality and will purchase more of them in the future.

Overall Review:
            If you were planning on getting an SSD don't get anything less than a Samsung 850 EVO.In Rust (Steam game) My load times to load into a server went from 3.18 Minutes/sec on the mentioned HDD above to literally 1 Minute on the 850 EVO.Saved me between 15-23 seconds on BOOT Up as well.Take my word, if you never owned an SSD like me and this is your first time there are 2 things I highly suggest you do and you won't regret.#1 Don't buy the 250GB Version, skip that and don't get anything smaller than the 500GB Version. My first SSD and I LOVE it!! I bought the 250GB Version and when I saw how fast it was I returned it for the 500GB Version 2 days after.#2 Don't buy anything other than a Samsung SSD, they are some of the best SSD's in the market. When compared and comparing Samsung 850 EVO and Other Samsung's SSD to other brands the 850 Supersedes the other SSD brands by at least 12-15% Minimum.I thought SSD's were just HYPE but I was wrong until I tried it, no regrets on my Purchase. Not sponsored just a normal Gamer on a budget. i7 6700K, GTX 970.
        ","
Pros:
                -Super Fast, at least 3 times faster than my WD 2TB 7200RPM Black HDD-Small, and very light, bigger than a credit card by an inch or so.-Easy to set up and install basically *Plug and Play, very simple.

            2 Quick and very important rules, you will thank me for it.#1 Don't cheap out and buy anything less than a 500GB SSD #2 Do not buy any other SSD other than the EVO serier 850 and up. Trust me if you look on reviews online the 850 EVO outperforms every other SSD on its category by at least a minimum of 10-12% if not more.My only regret? not buying the 500gb version instead of the 250GB. Bottom line, yes its a bit expensive, but only slightly compared to the boost your computer gets. Compared to my WD Black 2TB 7200RPM HDD this thing is lighting fast. No regrets on my purchase. Can't believe I waited to almost 2019 to believe all the hype. Loving it.

Pros:
                Love it, when people say its fast its literally super fast. I think I boot into Windows 7 in less than 13 seconds and that's after typing my password and all. Games load way faster now. Significantly faster, instead of waiting 30 seconds for a game to load (any game almost) It loads in less than half the time.

Overall Review:
            I've been very happy with the ones I put in my computer and the ones I use for backups. While HDDs are far more cost effective, their weight and size were creating problems for my old carcass. Not having to lug around and find room for a bunch of backup HDDs made the cost worthwhile for me (never mind that I'll be eating mustard sandwiches--without the bread--for a long time). Not everyone will be able to justify that expense. The increased speed when moving large amounts of data was a happy bonus for me.However, Samsung has since replaced the 850 series with the 860s. I recommend them over the 850s for lower price rather than buying new 850s. There would be no benefit to replacing perfectly good 850s with 860s, though.

Cons:
                Cloning instructions are a little confusing, says that any info not cloned will be wiped from the source drive, which is wrong (so I wasted time backing up ~ 500 gigs of data to another drive that was over what I wanted on the boot drive), and it does not come with a drive tray, so can be a pain in the rear to strap into place in the case, or you have to leave it loose.

Overall Review:
            I highly recommend this. Money wise, this is the best upgrade you can make on your computer if you do a bit of everything on it. Personally I do everything, from social media sites to watching movies to video games. Mostly video games. If you hate loading times as much as me, get this. If you hate low FPS and like good graphics, get a GPU first, then this. Also, keep in mind SSD's are very sturdy and highly unlikely to break down or be defective. Unlike many Graphics cards which have a much higher chance of having problems later down the road or being defective. A bit off topic here, but I highly recommend the Nividia Geforce GTX 960. It runs cool, it is sturdy, and it is well worth the money. Will play anything you throw at it on ultra if you have the processor to keep it from bottlenecking.
        ","
Pros:
                It will download on my old stock mobo at 400 mb's per second. I went from waiting sometimes 2 minutes for stuff to load all the way to waiting at most 12 seconds. After I installed my new Graphics card, the longest I wait now is 7 seconds. It takes 10 seconds to restart my computer, 5 seconds to boot it, 3 seconds to load GTA 5 (About 12 seconds before I installed my Nivida, GeForce GTX 960) and 4 seconds to load Fallout 4 on medium graphics settings, and 7 seconds on max settings. That should give you a general idea of how fast this bad boy is. Keep in mind, load times are affected mainly by SSD however GPU. CPU, and RAM also play a role in this. So times are subject to change depending on system hardware.EDIT: Over 1 year later and this bad boy is still working like new, only a few bad sectors (Dont freak out this is normal.) but at the rate its going, it should last around 20 years for me. Literally. SSDs last nearly as long as RAM if not longer.

Overall Review:
            I had to disconnect and reconnect the drive a few times when trying to find a good mounting position/cable management. The connection board (not the connections themselves if that makes sense) feel a bit creaky/loose. I'm not concerned now that it's mounted, but it was a bit nerve-racking as I did fear it might break off. Never experienced this before. That aside, the Samsung EVO series is fantastic. Tons of reviews and benchmarks out there, so not much else for me to add. Although you pay a bit of a premium for Samsung products, for a few extra bucks, it's well worth the piece of mind that I'm getting a quality product. I recommend these drives to all my friends & customers -  you can't go wrong.

Cons:
                If you need to clone the drive you are replacing you should avoid Samsung and look at brands that include Acronis software. The data migration software included with this drive failed within a minute of starting it but that is apparently enough time to render the old drive useless and make a fresh install on the new one very complicated (in my case at least).  Price and lead time for shipping.... Wait for the sale don't pay more than 139 (saw it for 129 as well)! I watched the price drop 2 times while waiting 7 days to receive the one I ordered because I'm to cheap to pay shipping and it shipped from California to the east coast. Most of my NE purchases come from N.J. to P.A. so the wait was unexpected but that's on me I suppose.

                GREAT quality product. Samsung drives are high quality and reliable. Comes with magician software which makes this drive screaming fast. 5-6 seconds to windows 10 after i press the power button. WAY faster then the WD 120 gig SSD i had better. SUPER fast. For fun, Installed in my Ps4 Pro and saw barely any difference, (this is due to what all the websites are saying, the PS4 and consoles in general are just dont take advantage of the speed. Even the main menu of the PS4 didnt seem any faster or snappir. shame on sony. Put back in my PC and what a difference. beautiful drive. have used 3 samsung drives now, the 250 gig version, the 500 gig version and the m.2 evo 960. they are all amazing. use the magaician software and reserve 30 gigs of free space, and the drive will be even faster.

Overall Review:
            I tried to use Apple's disk utility to clone my HD to the SSD. But got nothing but errors, issues and bullsh!t. Only thing that worked was reformatting the SSD to get it ready for use. Time Machine, also didn't help much. I was getting very frustrated with my purchase and was reading everything I could about the problems. Finally I decided to use Carbon Copy Cloner (who had actually gave me issues before in the past) but this time it worked perfect. Took 9 hours to clone my HD. Opened the mac, swapped it out and everything worked great!Also, Amzn sells the same drive for a few bucks less, but it took 11 days to leave the factory, and 60 in shipping transit, without tracking numbers, only to finally never arrive and they said ""maybe its in customs"" but were not willing to find my package or help at all. In the end I waited 70 days to get my money back, plus $8. I was happy to have this SSD arrive in 1 day. Thank you!

Before it was so slow that it would honestly make me rage but now it's just stupid fast. I remember just opening Google Chrome and it would take like ten seconds if not more to open upon my computer starting up and going into the desktop.... now it's literally instantaneous, this applies to my loading screens in games, opening anything in general... even texture pop ins in games is not what it used to be.Now this is where I really really love this SSD and Samsung in general. the Samsung Magician software is incredible. I feel like Samsung spoiled me with this. As you read above, you can see how DRASTIC the speeds in both read and write increased by simply having this awesome little piece of software.I would give this a 10/10 if possible, it's really THAT good.

Cons:
                I bought two of these drives.  One to install in my Lenovo laptop.  Following the Samsung install instructions.  Data clone failed.  Called Samsung tech.  They said clone again or do a fresh Win 10 install.  No way.  Ran chkdsk before clone.  Errors corrected.  Samsung should inform people how to prepare their HD before cloning.  Tried clone again.  This time it worked.  Laptop is running normally with SSD.  Now the desktop install which still is a nightmare two weeks later.  Prepared HD for clone.  Delete stuff.  Defrag, Chkdsk.  Cloned HD.  Tried to run Samsung SSD.  Got win 10 errors.  Win 10 wouldn't run.  Had to repair boot files from Win 10 with install disks.   Desktop now runs win 10.  Internet won't work.  Had internet tech out to the house.  Hardware all ok.   Called Samsung again.  They said update drivers on all hardware.  Complained about their terrible install instruction and poor support recommendations.   New drivers?  My previous desktop setup run with the original HD for a yr previously no problem.  Updated drivers any way.  If I put the original HD back in the desktop everything works fine.  Tried SSD again.  Device manager all ok.  Connected to internet ok.  Can't access DNS server.  Can't find any help from internet sites.  Re cloned SSD.  Same problem.  Everything works fine except in win 10 and my programs except can't access DNS and load web pages.  Gave up trying to use the second SSD.  Put the original HD back in the desktop.  Samsung support didn't help in either situation.

239,Greate SSD! The included software.... not so much.,"
Overall Review:
            - I would definitely recommend this SSD- Don't use the cloning software that comes on the disk with the SSD. I used EaseUS Todo free and it worked much better. (You will need some sort of SATA to USB enclosure or something else to connected it to your PC and clone it as well)- Get it on sale if you can, which shouldn't be a problem since it often is.
        ","
Pros:
                - Very fast replacement for my 4 year old laptop HDD. It literally boots in 5 seconds and has no slowdown from the drive whatsoever. My hard drive is actually faster than my internet now!- Easy installation- Capacity is perfect for a laptop, unless you have crazy large games or media files.
            ","
Cons:
                Not worth taking an egg off, but the included cloning software is not the best... It seemed to work fine but after 4 hours of cloning my old drive it froze at 99% and I had to cancel it. I ended up using a free software to clone the drive at it worked perfectly, and in less than 2 hours.

245,Still my all-time Favorite SSD's,"
Overall Review:
            I would highly recommend this for anyone who's on the fence or thinking about trying one. Coupled with a genuine mobo that has genuine Sata 3 6 on board your start time will easily be less than 30 secnds form cold dead to on the internet. My most recent build has a 16 second cold start to internet time frame! That means I push the power button and I'm on the internet in 16 seconds flat, no joke!At this point the ONLY reason I even use HDD's is for bulk storage only.
        ","
Pros:
                Having started with an SSD back in the early 2000's (64Gb), I've been using them since then even with the previously higher cost. To me it just made sense rather than to spend so much time waiting for an HDD since I'm on my computer for 8-10 hrs a day either researching or working on other computers through remote access. The amount of time saved cumulatively was well worth the cost and now that they're even cheaper and bigger, all the better. I had been a user of OCZ brand as well as a few San Disks and even a Mushkin here and there so I've been across the board with them. OCZ's always gave the best performance and reliability but were a little bit more expensive most of the time.When Samsung decided to start manufacturing their own I gave them a try since they had a better package and performance software included. Never looked back! The TRIM feature works very well and the performance is always good! One thing you'll find out with most SSD's is once they get about 1/2 to 3/4 full the speed performance degredates a little but is still faster than a 12,000 rpm HDD. I also like the brushed aluminum black finish. It goes into any colored case and always looks good.  Performance is excellent and muc lower power consumption than HDD's. To me these should be in every laptop too!

            I have a couple installed in my build in a RAID 0 configuration to get 1TB of storage for games. It's not cheap to do but if you can afford to do that, it's well worth the investment. I love being among the first people, sometimes the first person, to load into a level or world in an online game! I also got one of these SSDs for my brother to upgrade from his Toshiba HDD. Samsung's disk cloning software took the blank drive and make it a fully functional copy of Windows 10 with all his games and data in less than 30 minutes.

Overall Review:
            For most home computer users this model is a popular choice, and rightly so. However, if you want to copy lots of large files like movies, extended video clips, databases, etc. you may wish to consider a different model. That's because when Writing/saving very large files the performance of the 850 EVO is drastically reduced. This is a limitation of TLC-type NAND in general. Currently the best SSD model for Write-heavy situations is the Sandisk Extreme Pro which uses the inherently superior and more durable MLC-type NAND chips and is backed by a 10-year warranty.  Interestingly, the Sandisk Extreme Pro is only a few dollars different in price from the 850 EVO and way cheaper than the 850 Pro. You pays your money and takes your choice, as they say.
        ","
Pros:
                UPDATE 12-18-2017:Someone mentioned that when they needed help from Samsung they were unable to easily find contact information. Surprised by that statement, I checked the ""WARRANTY"" tab next to the ""REVIEWS"" tab right here on the 850 EVO product webpage. The Warranty has a link to Samsung ""Support website"". I clicked on it and the Samsung support website opened immediately with a toll-free number prominently displayed. Not so hard to find, after all.3D-vertical NAND provides good performance from otherwise inferior TLC-type NAND chips.Samsung software ""borrows"" some of your computer's RAM memory as a cache to boost short-term performance.
            ","
Cons:
                Samsung are trying to avoid repeating their earlier mistake when their TLC-type NAND chips began losing customers' data if their computer was powered off for an extended period. Not surprisingly, that upset many users and Samsung worked hard to overcome the design fault. So far, the newer 850 EVO does not appear to suffer from that problem. And yet, cutting edge tech invariably has a surprise or two in store for early adopters.

271,Jet fast drive but you need to load the software to use the rapid speed option,"
Overall Review:
            Really nice Boot drive and I do recommend it. You just have to have an SSD that is fast if your using an i7 processor. Hope all this helped ya.
        ","
Pros:
                Once you engage the rapid speed option this drive flies. I do wish it didnt have to be a resident process to keep the speed but you do. I still wonder if Crusial is better but I do like this Samsung.
            ","
Cons:
                No screws came with it.  Well you have to have the rapid speed software running in order to get the fast speeds. Also you need to keep an eye on this app in your quick launch because I noticed for some reason the rapid speed was unchecked out of no where a couple of times.

Overall Review:
            I was really excited when I purchased this SSD and really needed it to replace my old corsair SSD which I used for several years. Unfortunately. I was sent a DOA and when I submitted an RMA it took 3 days for Newegg to send me a shipping label but that was only after I got fed up with waiting for the emailed shipping label and contacted their customer service department. It then took a week for them to recieve and process the RMA for them to send me another DOA... I really wanted to like this product but at this point... I have lost so much confidence in Newegg and Samsung.

277,Best Improvement,"
Overall Review:
            Highly recommend this drive.  I can't vouch for longevity yet, but the 5 year warranty is awesome. This was the single best performance boosting upgrade I have ever done. Win 10 boots to password screen in 18 seconds. I used to always put the computer into sleep mode to decrease the time waiting for a start up. Now I shut it down completely because the boot up is so quick.  The ONLY negative so far was the included data migration software. It didn't work. First attempt it locked up at 1%.  Second attempt it cloned the drive with no issues 100%, but took hours for about 150 gig of data...AND one problem. It would not boot. Not matter what I tried to do. I also found it a little weird that the installation instructions want you to connect it with an adapter (which is NOT included of course)  to an external USB port to transfer the data first and then install it onto the SATA bus. Why?  That is probably why it takes so long to copy data over. After many attempts in various ways I gave up and downloaded a third party free clone software and it migrated the data in less than one hour and booted right up. And did this with it installed on the SATA bus. Just disconnect the source when done.  You might think the company that makes the drive AND includes proprietary software to manage it would make sure it works with it.  I see others here have had success with it.  I guess it is some hit or miss thing depending on different drive interfaces maybe. But I won't knock off any eggs because of that...because the main deal is the performance and not only the boot up time but every application flies. You wont be disappointed with this drive.

            My understanding of SSD's is they are not as prone to failure compared to HDD's since there are no moving parts.  All of my HDD's have far outlasted this SSD and generally you start to see when a HDD is going to fail based on my experience.  When this SSD failed there was no indication of an impending failure only experience a lack of response followed by a re-boot.  My computer would not progress past the POST which I assumed was due to a motherboard or RAM failure.  Wrong assumption, the failure to complete POST was due to the malfunctioning boot drive (SSD) and resulted in spending $1000 to replace motherboard and CPU which also would not complete POST using the dead SSD.Not sure if this is a anomaly or an indication of poor quality by Samsung, irregardless I will not purchase another Samsung SSD.

            I understand that you can get a lemon with any computer part, I have been building systems for years, been there done that.But most of my experiences in the past have been that if a product is ""DOA"" from the get-go the manufactures have always replaced it with another new product. Being sent an item that has already been a problem for someone else regardless of having been ""fixed"" leaves me feeling short changed. I would not recommend buying one of these drives, and yes I am sure that there are just a ton of people out there that have had no problem with these SSD's. But my experience has been nothing but trouble, and as I stated above already, I doubt that I will be purchasing Samsung drives in the future.

                I have used Samsung HDD's over the years and had good results with them, this was my first try at a SSD looking to speed up boot up time. Not from the very get go has this product worked well if at all. I had to fight it to get Windows 10 Home installed and in less then a day the drive had read failures, went through all the usual repair attempts - all of which did not help.  Fooled around with it for a week and then contacted Samsung support, that was a long drawn-out procedure that did not install a lot of confidence for me either. After the drive came back to me - repaired via a firmware update according to the paperwork, I tried again, and guess what the same results. Contacted Samsung Support ""Again"" and the gentleman said that he would put it through as a replacement for me. Sent the drive back in and waited for my new drive.  Yeah well what came back to me was a ""refurbished"" drive, this I find to be a slap in the face for a new drive that did  not work ""out of the box""! I bought a new drive and when it does not work out of the box I would think one would get another new drive to replace it. So here I am with someone else's problem drive that has been ""fixed"", wow how nice of them. Yes the ""fixed"" drive did format and I was able to install Windows 10 Home on it, but the drive sit in the hutch of my desk as I just do not have any faith that it will hold up if I put it in my machine. I have already wasted a good month fighting with the original drive I bought. I can not see myself buying Samsung drives in the future now.

Overall Review:
            This is my first experience with an SSD, so I am not able to compare to other models.  I've only been using this for a couple weeks, so too early to comment on reliability.  I am putting this into a computer that has had very high specs for a long time, but those high specs were choked out by the bottleneck of a HDD read and write speed.  Now that I have a very fast SSD, the computer feels like a brand new much-upgraded machine, and all of the other hardware of the box finally has a chance to shine.  I tried a 4TB hybrid drive, but I really didn't see much difference from a traditional HDD.  This, on the other hand makes a very noticeable difference in performance.  I should have done this years ago.  Don't wait like I did.  Get yourself a real SSD for booting and programs.  It makes your computer sooooo much faster.
        ","
Pros:
                Typical advantages of SSD vs HDD: Very noticeably faster than traditional spinning-platter HDDs, uses less power, 100% silent.Much lighter than I expected; weighs next to nothing.  I knew it wouldn't be heavy, but it was still a surprise how light it is; almost feels empty.Flat black color doesn't interfere with any sort of design in a case if applicable.I noticed a lot of recommendations and positive reviews for this specific product when shopping, which is why I chose it.The seller, packaging, and delivery time were all pretty good.Basically plug-n-play.  Super easy setup.
            ","
Cons:
                Like any SSD, the cost per gig is far more than that of a traditional spinning-platter HDD.If you need to store more data than its capacity, you have to have a separate storage drive.  In my case I had to look up how to relocate the ""My Documents"", ""My Pictures"", ""My Videos"", ""My Music"", ""Downloads"", etc. folders to a storage drive while still maintaining their native functionality.  There are relatively easy tutorials that show how to do this all over the internet.

It's original HDD went corrupt and then the new HDD I put also started going corrupt. since other components were doing fine I decided to try a third time (third time is the charm right?) but this time with an SSD which are renowned for their longevity. And it works perfectly now. much faster. No more 10 mins long windows updates and no more 2-3 min boot times. the system boots up in about 15-20 seconds. worth the buck if you are putting off upgrading to a newer laptop and want to get a cheap and efficient makeover. highest performance vs cost ratio.experience with newegg:delivery was quick and well packaged. No defects in the item.before this I got a 960 pro which has even faster speeds than the 850 series however 960 series of samsung requires an M.2 port which my laptop didn't have (should have checked before ordering).

Pros:
                I just love SSD's in general.  This unit comes with software to transfer your current hard drive to the new SSD.  Make sure you purchase a USB to SATA cable  like the RCUC-16001.  If you are installing in a Desktop, you will need a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter like 9SIABR04YT6756 (NewEgg).  The software included works great to transfer between hard drives.  Just hook it up, run the software, install your drive and you are running screaming fast on the SSD.

I remember two years ago I ran Crystal Disk Mark on both the ssds and samsung benchmarks was at least 50-100 mbs faster than crucial but now this samsung is running 100+ mbs slower than the crucial ssd! The crucial ssd has not changed too much still around 550 mbs read speed but the samsung has dropped to 395 mbs read speed, in fact the write speed is now at 405 mbs faster than the read! Google around and this seems to be a known issue that after some times the samsung read speed slows to a crawl. I have downloaded the samsung magician software but that didn't do much at all... too bad cannot go back in time and not buy benchmark optimized samsung ssd.

I can't believe I waited so long.

Overall Review:
            I bought this with the intention of installing it on an nVidia Jetson TK1 for extra storage and to provide space for a swap file. It was essentially just plug-and-play, which is super impressive considering that it is running with a low-power ARM CPU. No driver installs, just needed to format the drive and set the system to auto-mount it on startup. Unfortunately, there isn't really a way to benchmark with the native tools in such an environment (ARM CPU, modified & striped-down Ubuntu) and I didn't feel like writing my own or hunting down one that would work, but the whole system is now noticeably faster and smoother. Compiling code is nowhere near as painful as it used to be thanks to this drive and the swap file it is hosting.

362,Better than expected,"
Overall Review:
            I bought the Samsung SSD to be used as a test to determine if SSDs are now suitable for use in small business computers that store customer information. I have been a tech for over 40 years, which means that over 99% of everything I see is defective (customers do not call until something has gone wrong), and the memories of the early LCD displays and memory chips still cause me to be very cautious and to not trust any new product. I ran the tests on an MSI AM1m MB with an AMD 5350 2ghz APU and 16gb of ram.Boot Speed: On a Windows 8.1 PC, boot speed slowed from the original 12 seconds post-bios to the SSD speed of 24 seconds post-bios, likely caused by the need to load SSD software. Shut-down times remained reasonably similar. As a comparison, the SSD Windows 8.1 boot time is similar to Windows XP SP3 loading on the same hardware with a SATA2 HDD. Boot and shut-down speeds are not important, but they do give an idea of what to expect.Program Speed: Prefetch is disabled in the SSD software, so MS office programs load much slower (about 1 to 3 seconds as compared to about half a second on a SATA3 HDD, and as compared to almost instant on an XP SATA2 HDD). Non-prefetched programs like browsers and Libre office are much faster (around 9 seconds on the SSD as compared to 20 seconds or more on a HDD). Generally, I did not have any 'wow' moments for the SSD's speed, but the SSD does make the PC noticeably faster over all.Security: The primary concern is that sensitive customer data must be permanently destroyed when a HDD/SSD fails, and the only way to destroy the data is by destroying the HDD/SSD itself. Regardless of warranty, if a SSD fails the first minute after installation, the SSD must be destroyed. Destroying a $50 1tb HDD is no big deal, but destroying a brand new $180 500g SDD is uncomfortable.My thoughts: The SSD is good for personal computers, and I am tempted to install another Samsung SSD on one of my other PCs. At present, until the prices become competitive to HDDs, I will still not recommend relatively expensive SSDs for my 'thrifty' business customers who must store sensitive customer information.

Overall Review:
            Replaced the  TOSHIBA 1TB mechanical hard drive in my laptop. Still good, just might format it and put it in my PS4.I was lucky that the SATA controller on my laptop (Acer Aspire V5-591G) had ACHI already enabled, so there was no hassle of making any registry edits or changing anything through the BIOS. All I had to do was plug in the SSD using the USB to SATA cable, use the Samsung Data Migration software to clone which went through without a hitch, and swap in the drive in my laptop, three relatively small tasks. Cloning took about 20 minutes. Boot up was extremely fast. Cold boot to desktop screen in roughly 10-15 seconds and an additional 10 seconds to finish up loading system services and the stuff on the taskbar.Performance is astounding. Visual Studio 2015 and the Microsoft Office apps open up in the blink of an eye and games are quick to load up. And I have yet to turn on RAPID mode.Hopefully won't have any issues with this drive, though the 5 year warranty is reassuring. Will update if anything bad happens.

THEN they issue an RMA. This seems like a very backwards way of doing RMAs when you should be able to put on in online like EVERYONE else.  It was very frustrating. They also required a copy of the purchase receipt, even though the drive was only made 7 months ago, didn't matter.  When I asked why, the guy said ""well you could have bought it on an auction site"", like that should matter that the drive was used/pre-owned.  Again, frustrating.

                Back in 2012 I rebuilt an AMD desktop PC for my wife, and included a SAMSUNG 840 Pro Series 2.5"" 128GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-7PD128BW as the primary system drive, limited to containing the Windows 7 OS and program files, with the original old drive used for documents and files archiving. Recently the lash up with an ASUS Sabertooth 990 FX Mainboard, 8 Core AMD CPU and 16 GB of Ripjaw RAM failed to produce Nova Backup drive images. I eventually tracked this down to  the drive being nearly filled and ordered the Samsung 850 RVO 2.5"" 1TB SATA SSD Drive.It arrived in record time, overnight by USPS on a Saturday, from a local source, and I installed it before dinner. The drive came with a Samsung installation disk containing Samsung Data Migration and Magician software, no download necessary (although it did download a updated version automatically). Instead of using a USB adapter, I plugged the drive into a open SATA III MB port, hooked up a power cable, ran the software and cloned the original drive. Too easy! Then it was swapped into the drive bay and I was done. The first attempt at creating a Nova Backup image to an external drive went flawlessly. Wife was happy. The original 128 GB Samsung SSD Drive went five years without a hitch, except for being too small, so it can be expected that this one will be as solid.  Lesson learned; don't skimp on storage capacity, pay the bucks and reap the benefit.

It all fit neatly in a 5 1/2"" slot in the computer case. It was a useful method of installing ssd drive(s)  in an older computer case
        ","
Pros:
                Easy to set-up and use as primary drive. This type of SSD drive has much broader application in a far wider variety of computers. Would be an awesome back-up drive if building a new computer with even quicker varieties of SSD's that will only work in newer motherboards.
            ","
Cons:
                May not have a specific install location in older computer cases.

Overall Review:
            The way I see it, hard drive reliability is the #1 concern. And if you have to pay $30 extra to have extended life with these high performance SSDs, then I'd say it's worth it. After more than 2 years, the Samsung Magician software isn't giving me error codes or warnings for SSD health, and I don't expect it to anytime soon either.

Pros:
                I absolutely guarantee that you get the Samsung 850 Evo. I bought 2x 512GB 850 Evos over 2 years ago and I am still loving it. My operating system is super fast and all of my games load so quickly that I've been absolutely spoiled.I have also set each SSD to maximum reliability and they are still extremely fast. Not sure how many of the other SSD brands compare with reliability, but apparently the 850s are superb.

            So far, it works amazingly.  I installed Ark Survival to the SSD and the game loads up faster than ever.  Instead of waiting 10-15 minutes to load up a modded server, it takes 5 or so.  Which isn't the fault of the SSD, its just the game devs don't know how to optimize it any.  Otherwise Ark would load a LOT faster on the SSD.  It did improve my loading speed by 3 times however, when switching from my HDD to this SSD.

Thought it might have been corrupted files, etc but even after a completely fresh install of the OS (from using a USB to SATA adapter to another laptop) my laptop still couldn't boot the OS after reinstalling the SSD into it.

Pros:
                After opening the case, it took 5 minutes to install. When the system was powered up it was recognized correctly by the system bios, and Windows 7 saw it as well. Using the Disk Management tools in Windows 7 I formatted it (NTFS) and then copied all 380GB of my Steam and Origin games from my existing 2TB (D:) HDD onto it. Then I re-letterd the drives so the new Samsung SSD became the (D:) drive and since the original path for the games was preserved they all run fine. The only difference is that they now load incredibly fast with no pauses for texture or map loading! I'm very pleased with the performance of my new Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD.

Overall Review:
            In reference to wmelin comment (see other questions and comments section) regarding power settings, you don't have to worry about putting an SSD drive to sleep or in standby mode as this setting does not apply to SSD - no moving parts or spinning platters. Apple's website mentions this. However if you do have the power setting turned on and you have an external hard drives (non-ssd) it will apply these types  of  external drives. It will power these down if not in use.
        ","
Pros:
                No problems installing it in my late 2011 17 inch MacBook Pro 2.5 Ghz with 16 Gb RAM. If you are installing as a replacement drive, and doing a clean install  from a bootable thumb drive- do not unplug the battery. If you do it will reset the date parameter and you will receive an ""signature verification"" error message which will stop your install right in its tracks. If this happens, some folks have recommended using terminal at startup to run sudo -u ntpdate command. This didn't work for me, so I had to put in the old drive, correct the date, and re-install the SSD. This worked for me and the install took with no additional issues. Word to the wise.

Overall Review:
            I'll explain my Con items, which are all related. My 'notebook' computers support only ONE hard drive, unless you use (A) an adapter/converter for USB; or (B) sacrifice the DVD drive and install a hard drive on that interface.Eventually, I was able to use a snail-mail delivered USB adapter. (None are stocked in local stores in my city.) But I was surprised and disappointed  that I was unable to use the ""system transfer"" program within a desktop computer, also running Windows 7. (The desktop has 8 SATA ports, and I plugged in both the new SSD and the hard disk from the laptop.) I was ready to do a system transfer from disk ""G"" into SSD hard drive ""H""...But Samsung's program insisted that the ""source drive"" ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY had to be hard drive ""C:"".  This is a really stupid limitation, and probably fixable in about 20 lines of code. Grrrr.

Pros:
                My second 850-EVO 250GB, first one is still going strong after a year. (Two different laptop computers.)Very easy to use ""system transfer"" and ""magician tuning"" software - *IF* you're running within the system to be transferred.

Cons:

Pros:
                Fast - even on my older MSI motherboard with SATA II speeds. Reads/Writes 256/256...

Great SSD.
            ","
Cons:
                The Magician Software Overprovisioning messes up sometimes if you want to clear any added OP set by you. The drive already has some OP set all on it's own and I found out that unless I'm doing a lot of writes, it's not really needed to add more OP. I had to get another program to clear the 10GB OP I set because the Magician Software wouldn't clear it, even though it could see the 10GB of space I set for it. Not a flaw of the SSD itself, so I won't deduct any eggs for that.

            -  Just look up tips and tricks online before you clone a drive. The software included is simply just ready to perform the function, meaning it doesn't coach you about pre-prep - cleaning up the original drive, ensuring no viruses, making a back-up etc.- I'm keeping the original 256GB Samsung drive as is, always worked great for several years, just needed a tad more space.- If you play a lot of games and find yourself uninstalling to make room, get this upgrade. (All my personal files I keep in an external; my internal SSD is only for programs as they should be on the same drive as the registry.)

        ","
Pros:
                Setting this up to be my bootdrive was easy and simple.  (Just make sure you hook it up to your fastest SATA input on motherboard, usually the 6GB/s one).  Makes boot-up and load-speeds incredibly fast.  - As of post, I've had 0 issues with this drive, and it's warranty makes me very confident of it's long-term reliability.
            ","
Cons:
                Storage space is still limited, so having mechanical hard drives is recommended.  250GB is probably the smallest you'll want to go for an SSD. That being said, 250GB is more than enough for the operating system, and your most-important applications.

Overall Review:
            I bought this unit as a replacement for my daughter's laptop. She needed the fastest I/O possible for the applications she was using (AutoCAD, 3D rendering, architecture modules, etc...). Installed it two years ago, was able to transfer her OS without a problem. It allowed to boot up in less than 8 seconds. Application load is literally ten times faster than with a SATA 3 HD, especially since her original HD was 5400 RPM drive.Have had absolutely no problems with it in the two years since. Would definitely recommend buying this. I even bought the 512 MB model for my own desktop as the OS/boot drive.Fantastic drive for the price.

Overall Review:
            Do yourself a favor and dip your toes into the SSD pool with a Samsung.  Even if you just get a 250GB Evo to run your OS and a few key games/programs, you are gonna be smiling from ear to ear.  You can expect your system to boot up in 10-20 seconds, not minutes.  Programs that you've installed on the SSD will start almost before you click on the shortcut.  This drive I just purchased is for my Dad's new computer.  He's been running an old Dell that has just continually degraded in performance year after year.  Rather than upgrade the system, I'm building him a new one.  The key to this new build?  This SSD.  With an Intel I3, 16GB of RAM and Evo SSD, he won't know what hit him.  Instead of waiting 10 minutes to use his computer after booting it up, he's gonna be able to sit down, press the power button and get right to surfing the internets and perusing the 15 years of email he has archived.  Ain't technology grand?
        ","
Pros:
                -I own 4 Samsung SSDs that I've purchased over the period of 5 years or so.  All are still running solid and all of them are still lightning fast.  Even my 840 Evo 1TB drive (which has a bad reputation in the industry) is going strong after 2 years of heavy desktop use.-In my experience Samsung is the most reliable SSDs available.-Fast, light weight, durable, power efficient, and pretty darn sexy.  If you haven't switched over to a SSD from an old fashioned platter ridden hard drive, you have absolutely NO idea of what you are missing.
            ","
Cons:
                -  Like all SSDs, limited lifespan based on usuage.  Not that platter based hard drives are immortal or immune to trouble either.  Just something to know if you write GBs of data every day.- Price per GB is still exponentially higher than platter based hard drives.  1TB SSD is around $350-$400 while 1TB 7200RPM HDs are around $50.

            My hardware RAID controller failed after only 4 days of use, although both hard drives seem to be working fine.

I was able to rebuild the array, everything's been fine since, and I'm pretty confident this hiccup wasn't due to the SSDs crapping out.EDIT (02/16/2017): I've not had any further problems with the RAID setup failing, so I'm going to chalk this incident up as either an error on my part, or simply just a one-off bug that's sorted itself out. Everything has been working perfectly fine for the past year.

I'm perfectly happy with them and I will buy more of them without hesitation if they are the appropriate SSD for the computer in question.  There's a reason Samsung sells a lot of these, and it's because they are very, very good.

578,Way faster than my old hard drive!,,"
Pros:
                The biggest upgrade you can make these days if you have an old hard drive is to switch to an SSD.  My new build with an SSD loads up windows 10 in about 5 seconds after you hit the power button.  My 8 year old system took way longer than that, usually a couple of minutes before I could start.  Installations take WAY less time, at least triple the speed.  Apps start up almost instantly when you click on an icon.  Plus the SSD makes no noise at all, the only way I can tell if it's running is by looking at the hard drive light on my case.
            ","
Cons:
                They are a bit pricey, but 1TB is starting to make more sense to buy, as they are getting cheaper and I feel like that I can fit just about everything I need in that amount of space.  I was debating getting a smaller SSD for Windows and the OS, and using another internal drive for storage, but I'm happy I stuck with just one big SSD.  I would get 2 TB but they are still too pricey.  I use a NAS as backup and extra storage for files I rarely use (e.g. installation files, movies, etc)

Cons:
                Box came in a padded envelope, squished in the corner/edge.  It works fine but maybe this isn't the best way to ship something so fragile/pricey?  It comes with HDD copying software, which I have easily used in the past to copy my original O.S HDD drive to a new SSD O.S. drive.  However, I tried it this time around and learned that this will ONLY work for an O.S. drive. ??? Why?  Why have software that can ONLY clone an O.S. drive?  What was Samsung thinking when they limited the function in this way?  I took off half an egg for that. Thankfully, there are freeware/trial programs out there that you can use to clone a secondary HDD onto this SSD but they really dropped the ball here.Buy mounting screws if you don't have them.  Samsung still does not ship those with these and you might have a hard time finding them when you need them otherwise.  I took half an egg off for that too.  Yes, some people will have these screws, but how much more would it cost them to send 4 with the package for those who don't? (As an aside, try asking Best Buy or another store for a few extra if you are out of luck and you might get lucky like I did!)

Windows starts up fine and sees the new drive as a secondary without any issues. That would be great if I weren't planning on putting my OS on it. So, I restart at the beginning and attempt to install Windows on the 850 EVO again, only this time, the computer doesn't even see the drive. This continued several more times until I gave up on it. Either, Windows didn't see the drive at all, or it wouldn't install because of ""80070057"".

Cons:
                After a year, performance started declining and issues started with lockups. I would run a scan and find problems and then repair. Problems increased and then one day it no longer worked. My system kept throwing an error until it totally locked up and could not even be seen by the bios. If you want a drive that has a short life span buy one of these or do your self a favor and buy one that has a history of a long life. For the cost, I guess I expected much more!

These people should not leave reviews for this product.I see people having the audacity to whine about an SSD not coming with SATA cables, for an SSD not having software to transfer the OS, blaming the SSD instead of the RAID software for bad RAID configurations, leaving bad reviews because the carrier lost the package...The SSD just works. Be sure to buy it and register it. In the event the SSD fails early, if you've registered the warranty Samsung or Newegg will replace it with a brand new one. Simple as that.

Overall Review:
            If I could afford another 500gb SSD Samsung Evo, I would like to purchase the mSata Samsung Evo 500gb SSD for my Alienware so I would have 2 in it for boot and storage without having to take out my DVD if I choose not to. However, if I did buy the mSata I would still want to reinstall the original 750gb HDD back In my Alienware for storage as well so I have even more space to use or to use as a dual boot system incase something goes wrong with the SSD. To reinstall the 750gb though I would have to buy a cradle that looks like the dvd drive, then I would have to remove my dvd from the laptop and use the space for the 750gb HDD.

Cons:
                The biggest con I have with both my 840 and 850 Evo SSD's are the migration software. I could be wrong, but I haven't found any way at all to clone my HDD - SSD without having to buy a data cable for such a thing. I tried the included software for hours in my desktop trying to migrate (clone) my HDD with my OS installed to my 840 Evo SSD and no matter what I did it would not work. I even tried Acronis cloning software (the most up to date version) with no luck at all. I got so mad it would not work, and that every single thing I found on doing it for it to work consisted of having to pay more money for something that if it was needed for the migration of your old drive to your new at the selling price these drives go for they should have come with such cable to do so instead of mislead any and all that don't have this cable by stating its so easy but not mentioning you need the cable to do it. I ended just doing a complete fresh install of my OS on both my desktop and my Alienware cause of this misconception of information about migrating your os from your hdd to your brand new faster ssd.I'm not going to take a star from this SSD for this lousy misconception of the software because the SSD performs very very well.

Cons:
                Does not play well with Windows 10 (then again what that is older than Windows 10 does?)When I bought this, I was still running Windows 7, and the migration software that everyone complained didn't work in Windows 10 did not work in Windows 7 either (3 tries - strike 3  and you're out).   So, used a third party drive cloner, installed (OK) and then tried to update to Windows 10.  Apparently the free upgrade build of Win-10 did not install well on most SSD's and Samsungs were unfindable by the Microsoft upgrade software.  Put HHD back in, update to Win-10, then clone to SSD.  All was OK for about 45 days, then started having problems with system/drive ""freezing"".  First noticed that if I put the system to sleep, rather than shutdown, sometime could not bring it back.  Then started noticing that if I left system sitting idle for several minutes, it would freeze/lockup.  Everything looks live, but no response to keyboard, or mouse, or network.Several days of internet research led to seeing several hundred (that I read, thousands more I skipped) of this problem with many SSDs, and especially Samsung.  Found only 3 possible solutions, and none of these worked (Actually one was to disable AHCI mode - but this isn't available in my BIOS, and Win-10 won't let you use the Intel storage controller driver  - even if you can get it installed, when you reboot windows puts its' driver back in place.Another ""fix"" was to turn off the ""PCI Express - Link State Power Management""  So that windows theoretically would NOT go to a reduced power mode when the system is idle.There is no mention of ANY problems / potential solutions on Samsung site.  And their ""Magician"" software has 3 functions: display drive status, enable/disable ""RAPID"" mode, run a drive performance test.  WOW real magic - ?All in all, nothing really terrible, but nothing to brag about either.And before anyone asks how i can be certain it is the drive?  Simple, cloned system back to a WD 500gb HDD, and all the problems were gone.  But of course everything loads slower, runs slightly slower....

Pros:
                It is super fast and is the best bang for the buck.  Our company laptops are aging and I have been putting in these drives to upgrade 3-5 year old Dell Latitude laptops.  It comes with cloning software that is very easy to use, but you will need a USB to SATA dock/converter to connect the SSD as a second drive on a laptop.  I install the Samsung software, hook up the EVO drive via USB, and clone it.  Then power down the laptop, install the EVO and set to the boot drive in BIOS.  If you have a desktop, you should be able to just connect the EVO to a second SATA port.The boot times are amazing, even with old laptops.  These make old laptops usable and productive again.  The 3D vertical NAND allows for more density in the memory, so it seems to run faster and use lest power, creating less heat.
            ","
Cons:
                My company uses BitLocker and found this to be a bit of a problem the first time I used the cloning software.  I found it is easiest to unencrypt the original drive, clone it, then re-enable BitLocker when I was all finished.  With the speed of this SSD, it didn't take that long.  If you use BitLocker, you may need to open the Samsung Magician software, select ""Data Security"" and then enable ""Encrypted Drive"" before reencrypting the new SSD with BitLocker.  The first time I tried to use Data Migration, I didn't unencrypt BitLocker and I had to use the BitLocker key to boot, then the ""Encrypted Drive"" option in Magician would not enable.  The error message in BitLocker led me to a file that I renamed so the system wouldn't see it, and then rebooted.  The file was recreated and I was able to re-enable Encrypted Drive and BitLocker without loosing my data.  Google the error message and you will find the file that lives in the Windows directory (I can't remember the file name, and was unable to find it with out the original error message that BitLocker was giving me).

Overall Review:
            As many of you reading this, I am rather astonished. Samsung has a very good reputation. Of course, there are always a number of defective units.  I believe that Samsung should be more careful to send a good unit after a defective one has been returned...

Pros:
                It is fast.
            ","
Cons:
                The unit has been defective a little more than one year after I have purchased it. I have looked for a way to apply the warranty, but I have been unable to easily find contact information.After a lot of search and bouncing from one phone call to the other, I finally got the phone number to return the defective SSD, and I had the 5-year warranty applied. The Samsung phone number that I have used is 855 726 8721.Once I have had the correct phone number, the process was easy and fast.However, they sent me a ""refurbished"" ssd. I used it for a day. When I tried to delete a few files the next day, it did not work well. ""Ghost"" files remained. I had to reformat. I decided to stop using the unit. Another way to say that I feel that I have wasted a lot of money.I must say that I have replaced the Samsung SSD by an Intel SSD that works great for the moment and that has a reputation for reliability (according to an IT specialist that I paid to help me with the defective SSD--adding to the wasted money).

This is supposed to be a present for my son, better computer and the game he has been wanting, all in one go. If I had ordered from the lady warriors site I would have the code, as I know people who have gotten the same drive at the same (great) price AND the code that ordered after I did.Support's reply has been to the tone of""The game should've been included, however it looks like we simply ran out of codes for this game from the manufacturer. If the game is back in stock, we can offer to you at no cost but you will have to inform us on the game being in stock again. This offer will be valid until 12/31/16""So I have to monitor the webpage that I have to google to find since it doesn't come up on newegg's search, and let THEM know when it is in stock???!!??

Of course it also does not include any of the cables necessary for data migration.  Wonderful, I purchased myself a chore.Next time Samsung wants to sell a $300.00+ piece of hardware they should think about throwing in the <$5.00 cables necessary to actually use it.Very disappointing, and totally unacceptable.

        ","
Pros:
                - Well the first pro is, it is fast and cheap. I am actually getting higher speeds than the box says. So if you have a decent comp, this SSD will be a bit faster than what it says. Only by 20-30, but hey that is awesome in my book.- Second pro is, the Samsung Data Migration program for hard drive/SSD cloning was fast and easy to use. I got sick of formatting and reinstalling drivers and setting up my comp the way I like it. So, I used the Samsung data migration (Cloning program) and all is well. I was going from an older SATA 3 SSD from 2012 and it copied 102 gigs in 14:02. Way faster than formatting, and as I have no issues w/ my comp, cloning was the to go, I do not know if the data migration is bundled w/ the SSD. I downloaded mine from the Samsung site. I also downloaded the Samsung Magician software to test the speed of the SSD.- I like the sleek look, it is simple but awesome.- The 3D NAND is what drew my attention to it, My old SSD has degraded a bit, so it is nice to have an SSD back to full speed.- Buy it, I did a bunch of research and from what I got out of it. The Samsung 850 Evo line is up to 30 percent faster than its Samsung 840 Line up,

Pros:
                Easy to install!  I had a SATAII to USB3 cable lying around, used Samsung's transfer software, which I downloaded from their website.  I thought it might have trouble because it's my boot drive and there are inevitably open drivers and files, but in this case, not so. It took about 10 minutes to transfer ~200gig of files.  Then I popped the old 256 gig WD Blue SSD out, replaced it with this drive, and booted.  After using the Samsung Magician software to optimize performance, boot time is about 1/3 what it was on the old SSD, as are game load times, etc.  No install issues!  It was the most painless hardware install I've had in awhile.
            ","
Cons:
                The included software is on a CD, and I don't have a drive (who does?) but  it was easy enough to download it from their website, which I would have done anyway to get the latest version.

675,6-month review.,"
Overall Review:
            If you're on the fence about an SSD, pull the trigger and buy this drive. Worried about the 150TB lifecycle of writes? I was. Let me put your mind at ease: I reloaded my entire OS (Windows 10), reloaded X-Plane, a ton of orthographic scenery, and all my daily-driver programs. Oh, and some virtual machines. So I've used this to write more aggressively over the past six months than my typical use.I have burned through 3.16TB of use. That means I have about 40, say, of these cycles left before the drive will statistically fail. This gives me an MTBF of 20 years. Let's say I have a first-third drive (got unlucky). Call this, what, 5 years of use? This is still really good for a HDD, and all the while I am getting the benefit of SPEED.If you're looking, if you're thinking about this drive, if this is the right price-point and form-factor for you, buy it.

Overall Review:
            I've been using a bunch of these in a NAS server for well over a year now without any issues, which is unusually when you have that many drives working together with a heavy workload.With a proper RAID configuration, you can get better speeds with a large number of small drives than a small number of large drives.  Going with TLC (EVOs) instead of MLC (Pros) will cancel out the increase in cost-per-GB, and maintenance is generally cheaper over the typical lifespan of such a RAID array.  If you're considering Pros for high-capacity, high-speed storage, you may want to give these EVOs a try instead.
        ","
Cons:
                - TLC, which isn't quite as fast or durable as MLC or SLC, but this shouldn't be an issue for most users.  The drive will likely be obsolete before durability becomes a concern, and the speed is still amazingly fast.

Overall Review:
            500GB does not equal 500GB according to your computer. Allow me to explain:All storage devices are measured in bytes, but it's not the same byte that your OS recognizes - computers can only recognize a base-2 numbering system, whereas we use a base-10 system. The closest value to 1000 that can be reached in base-2 is 1024 (or 2^10), hence 1,024 bytes = 1 kilobyte1,048,576 bytes (2^10*2^10 or 2^20bytes) = 1 Megabyte1,073,741,824 bytes ((2^10)^3) or 2^30 bytes) = 1 GigabyteWhat we consider 500 GB is actually 5*10^11 bytes, but a computer can only see it as 465.66 GB (5*10^11/2^30) thanks to this numbering system! So technically it's not the drive manufacturers who are ripping you off, it's a 17th Century German mathematician and his obsession with Chinese divination that's causing you to lose precious drive capacity.(It's also the industry' fault for standardizing human bytes over computer bytes)Samsung is one of the only manufacturers to design and build all of the components inside their SSDs, giving them a significant cost and development advantage as all aspects of their SSDs can be controlled in house. Only Toshiba and Intel have this top-down control over their SSD production, although they have used components from outside their company for lower-end consumer drives.The 850 EVO is a product of Samsung's industry advantage, being the first consumer SSD that combined the affordable TLC flash structure with vertical NAND (or V-NAND) density. In layman's term, Samsung can not only make cheaper flash memory, but they can cram more capacity in each package of flash memory, reducing the number or flash packages needed for certain capacities and further driving down costs. The 850 EVO comes in both 2TB and 4TB versions thanks to the benefits of vertical scaling in flash capacity increasing both the capacity of each flash die and the density of dies per package. They use the same number of flash packages as the 1TB 850 EVO, but are able to double or quadruple capacity thanks to this increase in number of dies and die capacity per package. This may soon affect prices of future 850 EVOs under 2TB.Right now, the 500GB Samsung 850 EVO uses 4 flash packages, with 8 dies per package, and a total capacity of 128 Gigabit (or 16 Gigabyte) per die. That's 32 dies of 16 Gigabyte each, or 512GB of total capacity. Approximately 12GB is left out for over-provisioning, so that's 500GB of usable storage (or 465GiB of ""actual"" storage). If Samsung chooses to trickle down these denser NAND packets, the next iteration of the 500GB 850 EVO will only have 2 flash packages with 16 dies per package and 16 GB per die (based on the 2TB EVO) or even a single flash package with 16 dies and 32GB per die (based on the 4TB EVO). Whether that will lead to a significant price drop is yet to be seen, since the denser die packages in the 2TB and 4TB EVOs are between 4 to 6 times the cost of the older EVOs' packages.
        ","
Pros:
                I think the internet is unanimous is pinning this drive as the standard to which all other TLC-NAND drives shall be judged. It has the sequential read and write speed that rivals more expensive MLC NAND prosumer drives, but at a middle-of-the-road cost.Samsung claims that the 500GB 850 EVO could survive up to 150TB of writes in its lifetime. That seems rather conservative, as the NAND wear I'm experiencing on my most used 850 EVO is 10.4TB total writes and it's B1 SMART value is only 16. It's still at 100% of its total write lifespan even after 10000 hours of use. I think the actual TBW lifespan for my oldest 850 EVO could be up to 1200TB of writes (Your mileage may vary). That's 48000 cycles of rage-induced game uninstallation and subsequent buyer's guilt reinstallation still left in this tiny black box.The higher write endurance would also explain the 5 year warranty on this drive. It's not industry leading, but it's much better than the 3 year warranties offered by nearly all of the 850 EVO's competitors.I liked it so much that I bought it twice.
            ","
Cons:
                There is a problem with all TLC NAND SSDs, whether they're planar or vertical: low write speed and low write endurance.Low Write Speed: A single TLC, short for Triple-Layer Cell, holds 3 bits of data over an MLC's (Multi-Layer Cell's) 2 bits. That's 50% more bits of data over an MLC, so it only needs two-thirds of the cell count per die to hold the same amount of data.But that extra bit means that a TLC holds 8 different states of charges in order to store information: 000, 001, 010, 011,100, 101, 110, 111. An MLC only holds 4 different states: 00, 01, 10, 11. When an SSD reads from its flash cells, it has to check each possible charge state in order to properly read the data, so an MLC cell has to be checked for just four states, but a TLC cell has to be checked for eight.This triple bit charge state check doubles the amount of time it takes for the flash controller to check each cell, hence why TLCs are inherently slower to read and write from. This is also why almost every single consumer TLC NAND SSD will have some sort of fast cache or memory installed next to the flash controller or integral to the flash packages, and the 850 EVO is no different. It features the same TurboWrite technology from the 840 EVO where the cache is just parts of the TLC dies. Unlike the rest of the cells in the die, these section of cells act like Single-Layer Cells (or SLCs) as they store one bit per cell (0 or 1) rather than three, making it four times as fast as TLCs and twice as fast as MLCs. In the 500GB 850 EVO, this faux-SLC cache is just 6GB, so any writes that exceeds this cache will revert to the TLC natural write speed. You will only get the advertised 520MB/s write speed and 90K random 4KB write (QD32) within this 6GB cache.The bright side is that the 500GB and higher 850 EVOs have a much more robust write performance compared to other TLC SSDs, sustaining 350-400 MB/s on my two 850 EVOs after the cache has been exceeded. I'm not certain if it has to do with the fact that the SSD's MGX controller is fast enough to swap freely with the SLC-emulating cache or if each NAND die on each package can be accessed much more efficiently, but this is still within cheap MLC-levels of write performance. Decent MLC SSDs will probably perform much better in RAID0 thanks to their higher write consistency.Low Write Endurance:Back to the three-bit density of a TLC: a single cell can hold 50% more bits than MLC, but can only last a fraction as long because of it. Cell wear due to writes is actually wear caused by electrons migrating through the die in order to change charge stages for a write. The cell must have a neutral charge in order for the charge states to be properly read, but it can gain a negative charge over time as electrons get trapped inside the cell walls. In order to compensate for this, the voltage used to read the charges has to be increased to a specific level where the charge states can be properly read again. Imagine continuously adding salt and lemon juice into a soup to get the taste just right; at some point you'll need to pour more water to reduce the salty citric flavor.Thanks to the increasing amount voltages needed to read the charge states, there is a snowballing degradation of the cell as the charge state check takes longer and longer until the controller gives up on that cell and renders it useless. To follow on the previous analogy, adding more water causes the soup to take longer to boil again until your soup becomes a lukewarm, flavorless briny lemon water and you pour the entire pot down the drain.Because TLCs are able to store more bits per cell, you're adding an additional teaspoons of salt and lemon juice over the two teaspoons for an MLC. Your soup will become a disgusting lemon brine that much quicker.Compare the 850 EVO's TBW lifespan with that of a similar capacity MLC SSD and you'll note that the expected life of those drives is often two to three times of that of the 850 EVO. Even though neither of my 850 EVOs have lost a single percent of their wear lifespan, that by no means implies that wear leveling will progress at the same rate for the rest of their lives. The 150TB TBW Samsung publishes might be a conservative estimate, but a reported TBW rating is the lowest endurance that this product can handle. Don't take it lightly.If you need longer guaranteed NAND endurance, look for MLC SSDs from reputable manufacturers. They will cost more and might even have slower reported speeds, but there is no substitution if you push your SSDs to the limits every day.

714,Super Slow random read and write speeds,"
Overall Review:
            First, I have used SSD's for many years now, and have installed them in everything. From gaming rigs to simple laptops, I always run SSD's and no longer use any traditional HDD's whatsoever. I have purchased Crucial ,OCZ, Munchkin, and Samsung SSD's. Typically the Samsung benched the best, but overall I have found that all of these other SSD's offered similar performance while in use, and only really showed any difference in benchmarks. Sizes used were from 120g to 500g, and everything in between.  Now my problem with the 500g Samsung EVO 850. I installed this as an upgrade to my EVO 850 250g drive. If you read the specs, the 500g drive shows a slight improvement in performance over the 250g, but not much. Still the last thing I thought would happen is a HUGE drop in random read and write speeds. These drives were both installed on an  ASUS Maximus VI Hero motherboard with a i7 4790K CPU, and low CAS (8) 1866 ram, running on Win 10 Pro 64 bit.  I cloned the 500 g off of the 250 g using the Samsung Magician software. The 500g speeds were 553 Sequential Read / 528 Sequential write. Decent speeds ! But the random read was down a bit at 71297 , still not horrible, but not even close to the 250g speeds. The random write speeds were only 28610 ! BTW, that 28k number is the best I have ever managed with this drive. The 250g 850 has 548 sq read /521 sq write /96887 ran read/ and 82967 ran write. First I thought maybe a bad cable, so I swapped the drive cables, so that the 500g drive was using the same cables from the 250g and was even connected to the same Sata port as the 250g was previously. Reran test, same results from both drives. The 250g performed great, but the 500g drive still had the pitiful random performance.  As a result, I contacted Samsung support to see if they could offer a suggestion as to what was going on here. I got the usual, did you do this, and did you do that responses. No help whatsoever. Also, their responses made some suggestions like ""what port was it in, do you have a bad cable or connection"" ? Clearly ignoring the simple and OBVIOUS fact that the 250g performed properly when connected to either of the sata ports while using either sets of cables ! So I'm thinking maybe the cloning was to blame. So now, I'm not wanting to wipe the 500g 850, so I decide to try all of the possible issues with Windows setup. No matter what settings i tried, the drive speeds remained the same. At least they are consistent ! So now I'm left with the last option. Wipe the disk, reformat and see if the cloning was to blame. The 500g drive is now th storage drive with the 250g as the boot/OS drive . I downloaded some games from Steam, after setting up the drive in disk management,, and reran the test again . SAME HORIBLE RANDOM READ AND WRITE SPEEDS AS BEFORE ! NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER ! CLEARLY THE DISK IS DEFECTIVE, AND IT'S POOR PERFORMAANCE HAS ZERO TO DO WITH SETUP OR CLONING ! JUST A BIG WASTE OF TIME ! Thanks Samsung ! My time may not be super valuable, but it is worth something to me ...

Cons:
                There is no AHCI in the bios for this motherboard which I believe causes the following. . .A pop-up message box is displayed after boot up saying that the Samsung Magician software is not communicating with the SSD.  I accepted the fact that this is happening but I contacted  Samsung support to see if there was some way to stop the message. (meaning some regedit alteration).  They said no.

730,Great product and Easy to Setup,"
Overall Review:
            Bought this to replace my dad's work laptop HDD. Bought this size to match the setup he currently has. The software made it a walk in the park to clone his drive. I did have to go out and buy a USB to SATA cable in order to make this happen, so don't forget to buy one and then hold onto it for dear life. Once done, I switched out the hard drives and it booted up faster and worked as if nothing had been changed. I'm thinking to buy another SSD for a future gaming rig, though I debate what size to get. Definitely improves boot time.

Overall Review:
            If you're even remotely thinking about an SSD and have the money to spend on one I'd recommend you do it. Get enough storage for your OS and your frequently used and resource-heavy programs. Keep your mechanical drive for storage (like games/movies/pcitures/whatnot) and enjoy the blistering load times.
        ","
Pros:
                This is my first SSD and I don't know why I waited so long. I knew when I freshened up my gaming rig I was going to reinstall on an SSD and just needed to decide which one to go with. The overwhelming majority of reviews and suggestions seemed to recommend the Samsung EVO 850 so I gave it a go. It's astonishing how quickly my system boots, loads background processes and is ready-to-go. No more waiting on Chrome's bloated processes to load up before I can open a browser. No more waiting to open resource intensive programs like Photoshop or Lightroom. This thing is ridiculously fast. Even installing programs is blazing quick now. This is one of the best computer-related quality-of-life improvements I've made.
            ","
Cons:
                I can't think of a single thing I dislike about this drive. Well, maybe one thing. All storage drive manufacturers do it, but the advertised capacity and the usable capacity are not the same. I got the 500GB model and only 465GB are usable for storage. It's not a big deal to me but it's just a thing that the industry does.

        ","
Pros:
                I bought this SSD a couple of months ago and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I pretty much bought this drive so that I could install my entire Steam Library on not just one drive but on an extremely fast drive as well. My library used to be installed on 2 different drives, most of which was on a HDD. The other SSD that was only a 128GB model and it was the drive I used for my windows boot drive. I had all my programs installed on that drive so I didn't have much room left for my Steam Library except for a couple of small games. Games like GTA V was stuck on a HDD which you don't need me to tell you that it was very slow to load. Now with my entire library on this SSD, every game loads in a fraction of the time. So if you're looking to put your Steam Library on a super fast drive like I did, or even to use as a boot drive to run you computer faster, you can't go wrong with this SSD. I know I will buy another one if I need another one in the future.  So go ahead and buy one, you won't regret it.

743,Great Drive Lousy Software,"
Overall Review:
            When I built my son's system I put in a 1 TB hard drive and partitioned it into two 500 GB logical drives.  I suspect this is a somewhat common occurrence.  I setup the C drive with the system and he used it for productivity programs    The D drive is mostly for games.  Given the size of games the D drive became full.  In addition his boot time seemed to be excessive thus entered the 500GB Samsung  850 EVO.The physical installation was simple one just has to make sure one has the cables and mounting hardware.  His case did not have a 2.5 inch bay but mounting hardware is dirt cheap.  One thing I would recommend is when purchasing SATA cables get ones that are angled 90° on one end.  After the physical install come the problem.  The software that Samsung provides will only do part of the job and that part is not really complete.  What should happen is that one should be able to run the software, have it clone the C boot partition to the new SSD,  change the SSD to the C drive, resize the D drive so it takes the entire mechanical disk without losing any data, and change the boot status so the system boots from the SSD.  This software provided by Samsung  does not do by a long shot.  Using the provided software you can clone the drive (which take a very long time) but that is it .  I ended up using Paragon Software Partition Manager 15 which was definitely up to the task.   Given that part of the price is the company's software the SSD is definitely over priced.

It's a more complicated process with Acronis you have to hook up the extra drive and then boot on to the Acronis disk etc.  PITA.

763,Cost vs. performance increase: a great value.,"
Overall Review:
            I initially tried buying a 250gb SSD and was going to supplement it with a HDD.  This can be easily done on linux, but Windows makes it very unpractical.  I tried this two ways in the past: hard links (Windows search doesn't like this, I fear there maybe unforeseen consequences too) and via file/folder properties moving documents and such to a new drive.  The latter leaves a lot of data behind in appdata - there was hundreds of gigs in there like iPhone/iPad backups and other stuff.  I decided it would be easier and I'd get more performance doing everything on one big SSD.  I'd suggest the same to you.
        ","
Pros:
                Extremely fast!  My desktop is a personal build and I've set out to do some upgrades.  This is the first upgrade and it is jaw-dropping.  You could save yourself hundreds installing this versus building a new computer.  It performs better than when it was new.  Don't forget less power and less heat.
            ","
Cons:
                SSD is far more expensive, but costs will continue to fall.

            - The only SSDs I use are Samsung 850 Evos & Pros. I've never had problems out of them. They include pretty good warranties should anything happen to them. Would highly recommend SSD only storage for gaming rigs. Everything loads so quick for games.- Samsung Magician software is pretty good. I always optimize my SSDs, enable rapid mode & over provisioning @ 10%.

Cons:
                - No screws included. Have to locate your own. I have tons of spare screws from over the years so I was able to find some that worked for me, but it sure would be nice if they could just include 4 screws that are the proper size and thread.

        ","
Pros:
                Amazingly fast speeds, especially when using the RAPID mode in the Magician software; plenty of storage for an OS-only environment; all the advantages a SSD offers; Magician software offers tons of options to get the most out of the drive in both performance and longevity.
            ","
Cons:
                Included Data Migration software is out-of-date and the updated software is very limited in capability. It will read from any drive but only write to their select list of Samsung drives. Even then, while migration of Windows 7 was flawless, XP-64bit had issues and I ended up doing clean installs of both to avoid any issues with dual-booting. You're better off going with something in a free trial like Macrium Reflect.  Also, if you plan on (dual)booting with XP, double check that your motherboard has AHCI drivers in order to get maximum performance. I'm stuck using IDE mode, but I'm fine with it as these drives are insanely fast, especially when compared to any HDD on the market. RAPID mode doesn't work with Windows XP 32/64. Over Provisioning option seems pointless if you're using it as an OS-only drive.

            - Make sure to enable AHCI and turn off digital driver signing in Windows 10 to get this drive up to full speeds. For some reason Windows 10 won't install the needed drivers and the drive won't recognize SATA or AHCI settings until you do.

            My startup with my old computer was a minute or two, new computer start up is about 10 seconds. Click to launch startup time for my games is now 2-5 seconds, for games such as Fallout 4, Skyrim, Spec Ops: the Line, and so on.Also, they have the PCIe version as an add-on card which eliminates the need for a SATA cord, but that one doesn't look as cool as this SSD does. I like all the internal parts of my computers to look as cool as the outside, even though no one will ever see them. That said, the PCIe interface is supposed to be faster but from what I've researched, in practical terms the difference is negligible unless you are running truly intensive video editing or rendering software.

My research came up with a number of candidates but ultimately I realized that most drives were still being compared to the Samsung EVO drives so why get anything else? It arrived promptly from Newegg and I had it up and running with my cloning software in a couple of hours. The thing that took the most time was the physical install in the box... that's always a bit of a pain. It's up and running perfectly and is noticeably quicker than the ADATA. Not by a lot but it is faster to open programs etc. Boot time is about the same to Windows 7.. approx 25 seconds.

Overall Review:
            As other reviews have said the box only comes with the drive and a software disk.  You need to get yourself a cable separately as well as any mounting bracket you want to use.  Honestly though as the drive is tiny and extremely light I found that is pretty effectively held in place just with the stiffness of the cable, if that makes sense.  My case never moves unless I'm opening it up so I'm really fine without mounting it and you might be too.
        ","
Pros:
                Very easy to install, the software that it comes with made cloning my old 1tb HDD really simple.   I pared my drive down to about 370gb and it took a little less than an hour to finish the clone.  My boot time for windows 10 on a cold startup had been well over a minute with the HDD, probably closer to 2 min,  but with SSD it is now closer to 15 or 20 seconds.  ITunes also used to take well over a minute to start for whatever stupid reason but is now instantaneous.  I'm not playing any high load time games right at the moment but I'm going to get back into Fallout 4 soon and I'll try to remember to revise this then.

Overall Review:
            3D Vertical NAND has solved the few issues that the 840 originally had. There's more consistent speed, less degredation, lower power, and greater longevity at a similar price to the previous generation. You can't really ask for more than that.

Make sure you download the latest software from their website for the magician software as it won't recognize windows 10 if you don't, and then you can't enable RAPID.-RAPID when enabled, makes this thing FLY, it uses some system RAM for like a cache enabling super fast initial bursts.

Pros:
                Blazingly fast!  It takes longer for the motherboard to go through the post process than it does to load the Windows OS.  Most programs load up in 2 or 3 seconds (games 2 or 3 seconds longer).  Small size is a plus as in my computer case they mounted in a small out of the way area.  While SSD drives are fast, setting 2 up in a Raid 0 configuration almost doubles the read/write speed.

In the year+ I've been using it, it's been exceptional. You can go cheap on a few things when upgrading your computer the three places you can't are Video, memory and storage. When I built my system, I built it around an AMD FX-8350. I added this hard drive, a ZOTAC GeForce GTX 970 4GB to the Corsair 16 Gb RAM and  MSI 990FXA-GD80 V2 motherboard. A friend (and customer) of mine bought a computer from HP based around an i7 chip. It had a 2 Tb spinner and the default Intel video chip set. In the competition, I was running at the desktop before his PC got through the ""Loading Windows"" bar. My system still loads Word in around 16 seconds, while his back then took over a minute and 10 seconds. His system cost more too. Mine was all Newegg parts. Again. if you want a good build, this drive deserves consideration.

With the original 5400RPM HDD it was booting up in about two minutes with a fresh OS load, with the new SSD it boots up in about thirty seconds. Runs cooler than the hard drive that came with it too, which is nice since there isn't a lot of air circulation in the drive bay of a laptop.

Cons:
                The TRIM functionality doesn't seem to run as often as it should, resulting in occasional slowdowns and decreases in performance. Not sure if that's a problem with my OS not liking to run TRIM on a drive this new, or a problem with the drive itself though. The Samsung Magician software has a functionality for running TRIM manually under the ""Performance Optimization"" tab, but it doesn't really seem to do anything on my PC when I tell it to run the optimization that actually affects the performance of the drive.

Overall Review:
            I would definitely recommend getting one if these, if you can get it on sale, then I'd say go for it, the joy you will get from your machine running so much faster will be worth it. If you are running a gaming machine, this might even give you a bit of an edge over your competition, since your load time will be much faster than someone on an HDD.I hope this review helps other decide if they should get one of these or not.Cheers
        ","
Pros:
                I purchased one of these a few months ago from a local computer shop, it was really just a convenience thing, the shop was 10 minutes away from me. Unfortunately the computer shops website is not really good for posting reviews, so I thought I'd post one here since the newegg site is great for that. I have purchased from newegg in the past and I had no problems with the purchases. Anyways the SSD was placed in to an ASUS G75V gaming laptop, which is approximately 3-4 years old, I was impressed by how much faster my laptop was after I replaced my C drive with this SSD. The laptop used to have a Hitachi 1TB HDD 7200rpm, and my laptop used to take approximately 5 minutes to boot to a fully loaded desktop. Now that I have the new SSD installed, it's boot time is less than 1 minute to a fully loaded desktop, it could be even faster to boot, but I still have one more of the original HDDs in the second drive slot, used for data storage and that slows down the machine a little. Without the HDD in drive bay 2, I found the boot time took approximately 30-45 seconds to a fully loaded desktop, meaning all my icons loaded in the system tray and the laptop was done loading the various processes and services. It was like I brought new life in to the laptop once again, everything else worked great and now my laptop was a speedy beast once again. I performed a clean install, the old HDD, was just that, old, so I figured why not do a clean install on a new drive. I have a lot of programs which I Installed to my laptop and it took a fraction of the time to install everything, compared to the time it took me the first time I setup my laptop when it was new and it had the 7200 RPM HDD as the C: drive. Additionally I also installed the Samsung software what came with the SSD to manage it better, not sure if that maters or not. One more thing to mention I did not install the Intel RST driver, I have found in the past, the RST drive can be buggy and cause all kinds of problems on a machine, so I avoided it. Here is some info on whether or not you need the Intel RST driver, spoiler alert, you don't need it..LOL.  http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-700708/intel-rapid-storage-technology-software.htmlLike I said, I purchased one of these a few months ago, and it is still going strong, fast and no errors or any problems from the drive to speak of. Also I believe the Evo comes with a 5 year warranty, so that has to suggest they are built with quality. Here is a link to another review site with plenty of specs, in case you were curious.http://www.storagereview.com/samsung_ssd_850_evo_ssd_review
            ","
Cons:
                The only con I can think of is the cost, even though they are coming down in price, the SSDs price per gig is a lot more than a standard HDD, a 1TB HDD is approximately $100, whereas a 1TB SSD is approximately $400 or a little less, so if you are on a tight budget, it might be a hard price to swallow. That said, it will be worth it if your current bottleneck is your HDD on your machine and you want faster speed out of it. Once you get over the sticker shock, you will most likely be happy with the results.

Pros:
                I bought this SSD for my games as some of the ones I play have very large maps that need to load and it was ridiculous waiting for the maps to load while playing online. I immediately threw my games on there and it sucked down all 500 gigabytes. The drive did slow a little bit, but the numbers are still really good. The random reads and writes both dropped about 10,000 iops but this is not noticeable in actual use and the resultant speed is still blazing. It used to take me minutes to get into an online match (BF4) and it now takes mere seconds. Also, this warranty is the best on the market.

Overall Review:
            I understand that SSDs have known longevity issues (although those have largely been addressed in the current generation), and that performance can (and will to some extent) degrade over time, but I'm hoping that my first SSD experience will be as positive as my experience with WD HDDs has been over the years. Based on the first day and Samsung's reputation, I'm looking forward to many years of speedy service from this SSD.
        ","
Pros:
                FAST!!! FAST!!! FAST!!! I've built my own system for years and lean toward the upper midrange, and for years I've insisted on WD 7200 RPM HDDs because of their speed, reliability and cost. Meanwhile, I've been hearing about the SSD revolution in speed and user experience.After living with 5+ min. usable boot times on my Win7 Core i5 4600K w/8GB RAM for several years, I've finally caved to the desire to get an SSD boot drive, and my research led me to the Samsung EVO 850 series. The cloning software worked well, but I wasn't able to follow the easy setup instructions (I'll talk about that in the cons). Nevertheless, once I got the system to boot from the SSD I was blown away! My 5+ minute boot sequence had been cut to <30 seconds! The overall system responsiveness was noticeably improved, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this lasts.
            ","
Cons:
                The external USB-SATA cable depicted in the easy setup instruction sheet to be used for data migration isn't included with the drive. As a consequence, I installed the drive internally, formatted it, then cloned my boot partitions. Long story short, I wasted several hours redoing several steps because I wasn't able to follow their ideal installation process (and I wanted to keep my HDD for bulk storage). Installation would have been smoother if Samsung had either included instructions or made provision for internal installation prior to data migration OR included the $5-10 transfer cable depicted in the instructions so I could have followed their installation process.

Overall Review:
            I bought this drive for my build after getting recommendations from people I trust.  Very glad I did so! I think it's a good choice for speedy storage, especially if you can't pay more for one of the PCI-E SSD solutions. I'm using this as the only drive in my computer right now, but may add more (either SSD or HDD) later, as my storage needs change.

Overall Review:
            I would definitely recommend upgrading your laptop with a SSD if you currently have a mechanical HD inside. Just make sure the physical size matches closely (or you have the customizing parts on hand). Actual memory size should be equal to or greater than what you are replacing to make the job easy. Watch for sales, new tech coming out in 16/17 could put this on sale, that would be a great time to grab one and upgrade.
        ","
Pros:
                -Fast, for the use I have for it.- Using Acronis True image to clone the drive is a snap, and the process only took 15 minutes, slightly longer than the actual drive swap in my laptop.- Laptop now feels faster and smoother operations overall, in spite of running Win 10 on it.

            Five Stars for the drive, but not sure about the software.  It could be I have no idea what I'm doing, or that the software doesn't do something right for UEFI stuff.  I love the drive and apparently Samsung has a lot of faith in this technology.  I am quite satisfied with the speed.  This SSD is thinner than the 1GIG spinning drive it replaced, so you may have to get a spacer or mini-cage for it.

Pros:
                Love the speed and the promised durability.  Put into a Dell 5000 series laptop (5559) replacing a 1GIG spinning drive.  The results are night-and-day.  Other than me being too stupid to figure out the software, I am more than happy.
            ","
Cons:
                OK, I guess I'm stupid, but I could not get the transfer software to work.... well, I guess work the way I wanted it.  I wanted a complete clone, but I could not figure it out.  It said it transferred the data, but then the laptop BIOS would freak out with the SSD cloned data and not load from the HDD.  I had to load Win10 clean from a USB stick to the drive and that seemed to work.  Wish I could have had a clean copy, but loading 10 from scratch wasn't bad.  Boots, shuts down, constant Win10 updates don't slow the laptop down any more.

            I didn't do the 'migration' because my PC's disks had already failed-- simply connected the SSD inside the computer and did an image restore from an external USB drive.

                Instructions are kind of odd, in that they do not include any words, just pictures.  Which is fine, except when the pictures imply a cable is needed, which I wrongly presumed was included, or should be included, in the box.  Hence, why I mention the need for an external enclosure (or a direct-connect cable).

Pros:
                Read 500+ and write 400+ with DISKS software in Linux Mint. About 1-5 percent faster rates than Mushkin Chronos and longer expected lifetime. Works out of the box with Linux/Windows/OSX on desktop hardware. It is 7mm thick, hence it is possible to migrate the disk to most laptops.

Cons:
                The 850 EVO is at the top of possible performance, with price/feature competition from other manufacturers. Longevity is expected, while we wait for history to report the result.

Pros:
                This SSD is by far one of the best that I have used.  It has a faster install time than others and the space required for OS and other productivity products.  Ran into a problem installing Windows 8 had to disconnect all other Hard Drives in order to install this drive as part of the computer build.   After installation of OS, MS Office, and other productivity software, the computer speed was increased moderately.  It will not make your computer superfast, but you will notice an increase in speed when pulling up any user's interface.  I also cloned a ADATA 480GB drive to this drive and the transfer came off flawlessly.  This is not a flaw, but if you clone Windows 10 to a drive that is larger than the original drive...it will setup a recovery partition between the the original data and the remaining portion of the drive.  With the recovery partition being in the middle you cannot expand the drive unless you remove the recovery partition.  You will also noticed an increase in speed going from the standard SATA HDD to an SSD.  I highly recommend this SSD if you are wanting to move from SATA spin up drives to one that is solid state.

Overall Review:
            The Mac Mini required a long shank T6 screwdriver which I ordered in a set.  There is a long 10 minute boot time - no fault of the SSD.  System.log says in three places its waiting for the IOKit to be quiet. This waiting accounts for 9 minutes.  No one has figured out the problem.  Also upgraded the machine from 1gb to 2gb hoping that would resolve the boot time issue.  It didn't but 2gb seems to be the right amount of RAM for this OS.

I'm an@lly retentive about how many drives are in my dinky little case (as in, I only want ONE in there) so I already wish I bought the 1TB instead. Also, I enabled RAPID mode and regretted it. Musta been a bit too rapid for my machine because I had to do a clean install. Not like I needed RAPID enabled in the first place, just wanted to see what happened.

            500GB capacity is a great middle-ground storage choice which allows for many options. Partition it in 2 or even 3 and use 2 partitions for a dual boot (2 O.S.) setup, and , leave a partition for storage (or Image Backups of both Operating Systems) with still room for your important file backups/storage.
        ","
Pros:
                I chose Samsung's 850 EVO 500GB SSD because of the dependability, sheer speed of file transfer rates of their drives.  500GB makes it a great choice for those who choose to have everything in one place.  Your Operating System response time is super quick and you have equally fast access to all of your installed programs or games, etc. It also works well as a secondary drive to store large files  you use on a regular basis. Samsung does an excellent job at delivering professional quality Solid State Drives and their included Samsung Magician Software Disc allows you to get every bit of speed, takes care of Firmware Updates and allows you to see how your drive is functioning. I'm running an 840 Pro 256GB, and 3 850 Evo 120's in 1 case and have yet to notice the slightest lag between the EVOs and the PRO model. The EVO 120GB is great for those on a tight budget. The EVO 250GB is an even better bargain if you're willing to spend a few dollars more, but, the EVO 500GB is very reasonably priced costing less than the price of 2 EVO 250GB SSDs here at Newegg . In a ""price per GB comparison"", and where more storage space is required; the SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5"" 500GB is the way to go !
            ","
Cons:
                (NOT ""Cons""): Keep in mind that: No Sata Cable, screws or other mounting hardware are included. This means: No bracket; again, NO MOUNTING hardware included. This is Samsung's standard packaging methodology. Please, keep this in mind if you intend to purchase the EVO (or any of Samsung's SSDs) and must use any of the above mentioned items.

You can do this by opening the Terminal and typing ""sudo trimforce enable"" (without the quotes) and rebooting. Windows users need not go through this step; TRIM is automatically enabled in all Microsoft operating systems that support it.

941,Instant fast computer,"
Overall Review:
            I have an older computer.  I7,950 running on a ASUS Sabertooth X58.  It's plenty fast for me.  But what isn't fast, has been the drive.  After years of accumulating software and updates to windows, booting take ages.  And whenever the games go to the drive for data, the hesitation is noticable.  Note that the X58 has SATA2 ports.  There are Sata3, but they go through another chip and run slower than the Sata2 ports -- not happy about that Asus...   But even with the ""slow"" Sata2 ports, replacing the drive with this instantly turned the computer into a speed champion again.  Boot times are now single digits of seconds.  Access to the drive is so quick, I can no longer get a beer waiting for the world to load in.  And in music production, the effects and instruments are so fast to summon you'd think they were already running.Even those without the SATA3 ports can use this drive to supercharge their pc.  This staves off the day you have to buy another monster computer.  And when you do, the drive here will be even faster in the new machine as well -- no moving parts means it'll last longer as well as run faster.

It's an old laptop. Also, I did not use the cloning software that came with it. I used Corsair's cloning kit (EZ Gig IV)  instead. It was really easy to use. I would have done this sooner, but back then SSDs were a bit pricey.

            I purchased this HD like 3 months ago. Installed windows 7 fine onto the drive. First problem was that I kept getting errors when trying to transfer huge files over from my external hd onto this  ssd drive(blue screen of death). I ended up just ignoring transfering files and using the computer as a music production computer. Last week working on music I kept getting blue screen of death errors again. Could not finish any track or anything. I decided to go ahead and reinstall windows once again. Installed windows 7 again, same problem with transferring large files from external. I reformatted and installed windows a 3rd time. This time I was able to transfer large files from my external ok. Figured finally solved the problem. Now today, when installing all my music programs again, blue screen of death and can't even log into safe mode without blue screening or windows repair without blue screening. I'm done with this hard drive and any Samsung ssd drive / hard drive ever again.

I have an I-3 @ 2.2Ghz on my laptop, CPU never used to get above 15-20%, now the CPU is peaking at 70%, now that its getting data at a high rate from the Drive...

Pros:
                The Samsung 850 EVO 2.5"" 500GB is a highly regarded SSD that utilizes 3-D vertical NAND, which is marketed to give superior performance and greater reliability. The max sequential read and writes are strong, and the 4KB random read and write are both above 90,000 IOPS. Install is simple and cloning went smoothly on Windows 10. In 4 months of usage I haven’t had any issues in about 2.44 TB written in normal usage.  Samsung Magician software is intuitive and professional looking. It makes it easy to find the serial number, firmware, capacity, drive status, total bytes written, AHCI mode, SATA interface, and OS optimization. Good performance and access time, comparable to benchmarks.
            ","
Cons:
                Not quite the same performance as the Pro model, but that is a different product and price point. The warranty is good at 5 years, but not as good as the 10 year warranty on the 850 Pro model.

I've simply had no *real* problems with them at all and I am most likely going to buy another one of these if I need another drive or build another new computer.  I've already helped guide friends and family to buy these, and I haven't had to help them troubleshoot any of them because they work fine and fast.

Cons:
                I have noticed some quirks with the Samsung magician software.  Nothing that affects drive performance or reliability, but for example on my desktop the Samsung magician software keeps shutting down on its own, and on all 3 of my computers if you open up magician and have it check for updates, it always says it has the latest version even if there are newer versions available for download.

You can see that in the magician software where you can actually make this drive faster in certain applications. Samsung also invented 3d vnand which adds more layers to increase durability of the cells themself increasing it's reliability. Also makes it cheap to make and those savings come to us.

                This SSD is great. I replaced a Vertex 4 128GB SSD. The Vertex 4 is also an amazing drive, it was just time for more storage space. This drive is noticeably snappier and launches Windows 10 almost 2 seconds faster. I knew that the 500GB SSD's are faster than the smaller drives so I can't say if there would be any gains over the bigger Vertex 4's  but was pleasantly surprised by the performance gains with this drive. It installs faster, launches programs faster and just seems more responsive overall. It is also smaller and lighter. Doesn't really make much difference in this form factor for my desktop. Just a note.

Pros:
                I bought two of these and used one to upgrade the hard drive in my Lenovo Z-50 laptop and the other I stuck in an Orico external HDD enclosure and installed all my Steam games on it. Since I only play them on the weekend it works out good for me. I just hook up the SSD in the external case and I'm good to go. I noticed that the games load on average 1-7 seconds faster than they used to, which isn't a whole lot but I could tell a difference. Its especially nice for those games which take a while to load.The one in my laptop has made a world of difference. Programs start up faster, the laptop restarts faster, files open instantly, its awesome! I recommend this to everyone who's looking to upgrade their HDD to a SSD. - Lightweight- No moving parts = more reliable than a traditional hard drive- Sleek and fast

            Both Dell and Samsung support are BAD. Both support personnel seem to me more worried about clearing requests than solving customer issues. Received canned answers from both. Samsung answer was sorry, you need to contact Dell (on the positive side they answered in hours). Dell's answer was, on your 7 month old laptop, you need to call us for a price..... I swore a decade ago I would never buy Dell again but a big box had what seemed like a good buy, I wish I had a time machine, no more Dell for me. Samsung, products are good out of the box, after that, one does not exist. My galaxy tab is missing so many Android security patches I have lost count. Just an FYI for AMD users, Samsung SSD firmware update does not work on AMD chipsets, that is unless you downgrade to generic msft drivers. I am in the industry, my customers call me for help on their PCs even though I neither sold nor support them. Building desktops or servers from scratch is a no brainer for our company. Dealing with non-white box units is a growing pain. It all comes down to support and proprietary software. I have yet to have a positive experience with Dell concerning my laptop, but this is not the forum for that. Samsung support, well  there isn't any.....

Acronis clone software wouldn't even try. Dell even sells the very same said Samsung SSD. SS said I needed to contact Dell to deal with SS software.....  Dell said get out your credit card. So SS software can not handle a mainstream PC makers product and Dell won't answer any questions without $. If either vendor even had a web page that deals with the issue (not uncommon) and potential workarounds I would be happy, but no.Samsung, please stop advertising product aspects that are not supported.

Overall Review:
            I am currently using this as my 'Game' drive, as well as for all Pictures, Music, Documents and Downloads (as you can choose which drive to default those items to). My OS drive as a Panasonic SSD and has been working very well and quick for the last 2 years, so I find no immediate reason to replace it with another drive. I have also turned my aging WD-HDD into a media drive for doing game recordings and editing.

Pros:
                This SSD is very fast; much faster than the WD-Black 1TB HDD I've been using for the last four years! (mind you, that WD drive has served me well, and I am in no way bashing WD).

I was told I would be emailed a shipping label to send it in for repair, or replacement if it can not be repaired. I asked how long it would take and was told 4+ business days.I never received an email with the shipping label. I had to call back, and then was told, they don't send shipping labels, I would be send a form to fill out, and then sent the address to send it to. (On my dime) I received the email, it required a copy of the receipt or invoice, a photo of the label on the drive, and to answer various questions about the drive. I will certainly investigate alternative brands to Samsung in the future. This is the second Samsung product I have had support issues with. The other one was a security camera system that they did not update to support newer browsers thus basically bricking the system for network use. (The main reason I purchased it)

Overall Review:
            I've used 840 Evo SSDs in the past, and had no problems at all - the migration software worked perfectly and quickly.However, this time around the Navigator software wouldn't recognize the drive and kept prompting me to ""connect a Samsung SSD."" Because I'd run this before, I thought the drive might be bad when neither my laptop nor my desktop could see it. The USB would connect, but no drive appeared in File Manager, etc. Because NewEgg has no tech support, I had to return the drive to find out. When the second drive did the same, I started looking for solutions. Eventually I found a post saying that the current release of Navigator simply does not recognize Windows 10. Not sure if that's correct, but it went on to tell how to use DISKPART to initialize the drive. After that, Windows could see the drive - but not Navigator. So I went to Best Buy and picked up their standard Apricorn cloning software and cable, which cloned my HDD onto the SDD in about 20 minutes. Swapped out the drives and I was in business.So, great drive, awful software. It's truly amazing that a huge corporation like Samsung can produce a state of the art SSD, but somehow can't manage a simple piece of functional cloning software - especially when there are many such available for download all over the interwebs. Just inexcusable! Really, shame on you, Samsung.

Overall Review:
            I have purchased about 100 Samsung EVO SSD. 128-500GB. I've also bought tons of other SSD drives.  These Samsung EVO are by far,  the best drives on the market for the money.  check Tom's hardware reviews for full specs,  reliability testing,  speeds,  and comparison.  it's a no brainer. If you have the correct mother board controller,  skill,  and extra money,  then go ahead and get the M.2 pro series. it is a wee bit faster,  but way more expensive and difficult to install,  clone, etc. The Samsung magician software is great and really speeds up the drive. the Samsung cloning software is a waste of time and I can't believe they even put it on the disk. really?  you'll have to get Easeus backup for free and it can clone all your drive partitions fine.  you also must buy your own ssd cables and 2.5 to 3.5 adapters for desktop installation.  but if you didn't know that already before you bought this drive, then you should be paying a professional to install it anyway.

Overall Review:
            This product is amazing! It is currently installed on my Mid 2012 Macbook Pro. After install I found my boot ups and application startup times significantly improved as an SSD would. It is reliable and very affordable! Since it comes from Samsung you will find that the quality of the SSD is as great as all their other products. Those who question this SSD keep in mind it IS Mac compatible. The price is just right for the amount of gigabytes you get and exceptional speeds. Its a nice looking SSD with all metal but of course its not gonna be outside the laptop since its an internal SSD. I am currently booting up from shutdown  in less than 20 seconds out of the minute and a half or more I got with the stock Toshiba HDD that comes with the mid 2012 and lesser models. GREAT BUY!

Overall Review:
            - Obviously there a lot of great reviews of this product.  The people who have failed drives after 9-10 months most likely didn't set their BIOS up correctly to support a SSD.  maybe there are some defected drives ones out there, but you see that same review on all brand SSD reviews.  Will I recommend this product to someone else, no.  Reason is, if they actually do quality control on these devices, how did an empty shell pass that control?  Again, PlatinumMicro did a great job in the return process.  I can't blame them for this drive.
        ","
Pros:
                - PlatinumMicro sent me a return label the same day I made my RMA and I paid 0 return shipping.- Migration software is great, it seems to be hard coded only to target Samsung drives.
            ","
Cons:
                - Received the SSD almost a week after all my other PC parts for this build arrived.- There was no migration USB cable that is mentioned in the migration instruction guide.- The saddest part and the reason why I returned this product is the fact that the drive itself was empty, it was a physically empty shell, hallow.  Yes, nothing on the inside. In 8 years of working in IT and receiving 1000s of parts, I've never seen anything like this.  to say the least, I was very disappointed.- My first review was deleted or never passed moderation.  It basically stated exactly what I said here.  If I double post, my bad, I needed to add in that PlatinumMicro's return policy was great anyways.

            ","
Cons:
                - None so far, other than the weird installation requirement. This drive was thinner than my original hard drives, so it goes undetected when you plug into a laptop (at least, mine) since the connectors don't touch! After seing a picture of the drive with duct tape on the net, we tried it and after 10 layers of duct tape, it worked perfectly fine. So, if you can't put the screw back, add duck tape on ONE side (the one opposite the one where the screws go in) until you can actually screw the drive properly. At that point, it should work. I wish they'd put 1 or 2 mm of extra plastic on the case so we wouldn't have to resort to such crazy procedure.

You'll need to supply your own [1] mounting bracket (2.5"" SATA Hard Drive to a 3.5"" or 5.25"" bay), the [2] attachment screws ([a] to mount the SSD to the bracket and [b] to mount the bracket to the HDD 5.25"" cage in the PC system unit). In this SSD replacement scenario, I reused the existing SATA power connector (from the power system unit) and SATA data connector (from the motherboard). Also, in order to clone the data from the source drive to the new SSD, you'll need, at minimum, a USB-to-2.5"" SATA hard drive adapter cable and the Samsung Data Migration (SDM) software. I say, ""at minimum,"" because you may need as I did, disk partition management software (I use AOMEI Partition Assistant).
            ","
Cons:
                I spent most of my time cloning the data from the 840 EVO SSD to the 850 EVO SSD. First, I used the SDM software to create the system partition and to clone the boot partition (with the operating system and data files) onto the new SSD. Also like other, my HP desktop has a hidden recovery partition labeled, ""HP_RECOVERY,"" which I wanted to include on the 850 EVO SSD. The SDM user manual states, ""The OEM Recovery partition created by the computer manufacturer as a factory setting will not be cloned ..."" From my experience, the SDM software did allow me to select the HP recovery partition; but, it allocated way more space than was needed. So instead as a second step with both 840 EVO and 850 EVO SSDs still attached to my PC, I created a new partition (destination SSD) the same size as the recovery partition (source SSD), copied the ""HP_RECOVERY"" partition to the new partition, and renamed the new partition to ""HP_RECOVERY."" This is when I used AOMEI Partition Assistant. After I completed the cloning operations, I tested the HP recovery partition. I found it booted into the recovery workspace just fine.

I was considering buying a new computer and it was well worth it to just buy the SSD and hold off for a few years before purchasing a new computer. Sometimes I have to run development/engineering software on it in a pinch and its extremely fast. Multiple instances are still a little sluggish but that should be expected with 8GB of RAM you can't blame the hard drive for that.

Pros:
                About nine months ago I bought a 500GB version of the Samsung 850 EVO for my aging laptop PC; even though it has SATA II ports, installing the SSD made a huge leap in performance. Certainly no different with the 1TB unit I bought about a month ago and installed in my homebrew PC with SATA III ports, which is over four years old now. From a coldstart to the Win 7 log-in screen used to take an excruciating amount of time; now it takes (usually) no more than 15 seconds or so. I suppose there are ways to shorten the boot time even more but I'm not gonna bother. Another BIG advantage is with resource-intensive software such as Logos 6 Bible software; complex searches take about 20% (maybe less!) of the time they used to with my old drive. These Samsung SSD's are phenomenal!!!!!

                Not really a con but when transferring your OS to this new SSD, it is absolutely imperative that you defragment your source drive before doing so. The data migration software supplied is NOT tolerant of fragmented source drives.

1152,Made my laptop run like new!,,"
Pros:
                I bought this to replace the hard drive in my year-old laptop.  It takes about ten minutes to install in my laptop (depending how knowledgeable you are about those things), another hour to reload the OS.  (I elected to do a clean install of windows instead of using the included migration software)  I am amazed at the difference it has made.  My laptop is an ASUS tp500la (about a $650 computer) and it is blazing fast now.  Before this upgrade, it took about 30 seconds to boot up from shutdown and a further 2-3 mins for it to load sufficiently to open anything without freezing.  Now, it takes about 10 seconds to boot up and be fully functional.  By way of comparison, it boots up just as quickly if not quicker than my dad's 6 month old hp omen (a $2000 computer).  It also opens programs and retrieves information amazingly fast as well.  I use Autocad on this laptop frequently and it opens in less than 10 seconds, compared to the several minutes it took with the hard drive.  I could not be happier with this purchase.  For $150, you can completely revamp your computer to run just as fast as one that would cost twice as more- it is literally like getting a new laptop

Pros:
                Upgraded my three-year old Monster Digital Daytona 240GB SSD (Still working great, BTW) to this Samsung 500GB unit. Installation was simple and straight forward. Cloning was relatively easy, although mine wasn't recognized via USB, but that's likely due to my reader, not the drive or software. Plugged the drive directly into the MB and software recognized it and off it went into installation mode. Drive is responsive, slightly faster than the Monster, and the maintenance software is a nice touch. I hope it lasts as long as the Monster Daytona did. That's getting recycled into another machine as it still has legs.

        ","
Pros:
                I got it for sale around Christmas for pretty cheap so it was great price to performance storage for me. It is an SSD and like all SSDs they are much more snappy and faster responding than mechanical hard drives. The startup time from completely off is like 15 seconds. It's incredible.
            ","
Cons:
                It didn't come with any hardware to install it in your case. This wasn't a problem for me because my case has tool-less installation for hard drives and SSDs. It didn't affect me so I don't feel the need to take an egg away but I thought it should be mentioned.

Overall Review:
            I upgraded to this from an OCZ Trion 100, and it is like night and day in performance. The Trion had a read write comparable to the Evo, but the random and write rates are much worse. I could notice the rather jarring slowdowns on writing, while on the Evo i did not. This particular model is also 500GB, which is enough for you to install many programs on it instead of having a secondary ""data"" drive. I am exceptionally happy with this product, and highly recommend it if you need a robust SSD.

1165,A pretty nice inexpensive upgrade,"
Overall Review:
            I had been resisting the urge to upgrade to an SSD for so long since I have been more than happy with 7200 RPM hard drives and would rather put money into the most important parts of a gaming PC: e.g., gpu, cpu, board, and ram. But SSDs have gotten so cheap now it was an obvious upgrade to make for my system. I don't think an SSD gives the night and day difference it's always hyped to do, at least if you're running decent 7200 rpm drives already, but it is an obviously noticeable difference. For instance, loading a save in Fallout 4 seems to take about half the time on this 850 EVO as it does on my Seagate 7200 RPM drive I had the game installed on before. So it's not a huge deal but it's definitely nice to have. Overall I can highly recommend this drive for a gaming pc, as loading is definitely more pleasant with a good SSD than a good HDD.
        ","
Pros:
                1. My games and programs load quicker.2. Windows boots quicker.3. 250GB is plenty for installing Windows, a few large programs (e.g., TeXLive, Mathematica, Visual Studio), and a few large games while still having 10% free space for over provisioning.4. The Samsung Magician software is nice for setting up the over provisioning painlessly.5. Samsung makes the best memory right now and you know you're getting Samsung memory in a Samsung drive.6. An SSD makes no noise.
            ","
Cons:
                1. The 500GB model is probably better for the money if you like to install a lot of games.

Transferring data from old hard drive to SSD was simple with Samsung's Data Migration tool.

I then ordered another new ssd from newegg.  When it comes next week I'll try again.  I had no problems with the xps 8700 before this incident.

Pros:
                Very fair price for performance. read/Write speeds vary greatly among SSDs, though they are almost all significantly better than any HDD, Samsungs evo is near the top of this chart. The only way you're realistically going to beat this thing is when they make the PCIE/m.2 a more common and affordable option.If you're upgrading from an HDD, you'll be shocked when you turn your computer on and windows is waiting b for you by the time your monitor turns on. Genuinely impressive, and the form factor is even small enough to swap into many laptops, i'd reccomend this over a RAM upgrade.

            This was my first venture into the world of SSD's and I must say I am thoroughly impressed. I was thinking of going with the cheap alternative like adata or sandisk but from everything I read they have high fail rates and they don't come with any software for managing the device and maintaining it. That is where Samsung has thoroughly impressed me. It comes bundled along with software that will not only optimize your drive for your specific needs but will also make your transfer seamless if you want to keep your old data and just enjoy the speed of an ssd. Not only does it do this for you but you can also make a bootable drive that can be used to format your ssd the correct way that Samsung designed it to be formatted thus extending the life of your product. I have only had it running for a few days but I am sure that this product will not let me down.

Pros:
                Slapped this SSD right into my computer, loaded Windows 8.1 Enterprise (got enterprise for now just so I can play games until I get my official legit Windows 8.1 OEM disc/key), installed all of my programs on it, and it loads everything slightly faster than my previous SSD I had which is the Silicon Power S60 240GB Sata 3. I use Adobe Premiere Pro to make a lot of drum covers and some other types of videos and I'm very happy to see and witness how fast this SSD loads everything. Same with my games, they boot up probably miliseconds or a couple seconds faster than my previous SSD. Just to give you an idea the silicon power s60 SSD I had, I THINK had read/write speeds of 450MB/s read speed or something and write speed was like 410MB/s or something, I'd have to look at the specs again on it. Whereas on this SSD the speeds are like 550MB/s read speed and 540MB/s write speed. Considerably faster and I definitely noticed a difference when using Adobe Premiere, Open Broadcast Software, my Playstation 2 emulator program, and microsoft office programs. I would definitely recommend this SSD for anyone who is looking for performance SSD's and what not. Granted there are faster SSD's out there than this, I still would recommend this to anyone looking for one like i said.

Makes the entire system run smoother when used as a system drive, but really that is the only thing it should be used for.It is like trading out a 1 liter four cylinder for a 7 liter V12 that is 1000% more efficient with 10% of the weight.

1262,Typical Top Of The Line Samsung SSD Quality,"
Overall Review:
            Here's a list of the main components making up her system.Intel 4790K processor, 32 GB G.Skills 1600 memory, Corsair CX750m PSU, EVGA 740 GPU, Gigabyte Z97X-Gaming 5 motherboard and Windows 7 Pro x64 . A simple speed illustration, she can have her desktop showing, click restart and less than 30 seconds her desktop is back and her computer is ready to go. And that's with approximately 85 processes running in the background. That won't set any world records but that's pretty good.My wife is a lite gamer. Mainly, online and a few low GPU stressing PC games. This system rocks. Been up and running for about a month as I type this. Not 1 BSOD  and no nagging system freezes. I contribute time tested quality brand name components and the Samsung SSD as an integral part of the perfection puzzle. Bottom line...For a boot drive, you can't go wrong with a Samsung SSD. I have one as the boot drive for my computer too. I wouldn't have nothing else.

Pros:
                I waited about 1 month before writing this review.Fast - Reliable - Great software to optimise your system. This is my wife's build. I set set the SSD on ""reliability"".

Cons:
                Cons:-Does not include any mounting equipment. -Drive has some bad sectors on arrival. Only reads as 450GB/500GB, a 10% difference.-Included software is simple, but not fantastic. Has to be updated once installed off CD.  -Setup instructions for drive are garbage. Good thing this isn't my first rodeo or I would have assumed drive was DOA. Literally, a pictographic installation guide that assumes you have equipment that should be included but isn't. Does not cover initializing or formatting the drive. Assumes you want to copy your OS to the new drive, and all instructions ultimately lead you to installing useless software.-Included data migration tool is terrible. Does not let you select a different source OR target disk, so if you want to move data from any drive other than your OS to your new SSD, must be done manually.

The First time New Egg was out of stock, sigh and I paid 10 bucks more (each) for three of them.  I found I needed two more a week later (12/18/2015) and came to new-egg and they were advertising them n the front page for 229.00...Why???   So, I went and ordered from Aamzonia.  New Egg here is where you see how you lost a sale, for the second time.  Later after I had ordered additional ones I wanted from Amazonia, I came back to be an annoying review and noticed they had it with no price when I manually searched for MZ-75E500B/AM...But there was a whisper...hey come click here to see it in the basket.  Shhhhhh it was 139 a week ago, but now it is 159....hey it was 229 a bit ago on the main page....come on this is a great savings.  Sadly Amazonia pricing was 159 on my three drive purchase and this time it was 149 on the other two. New Egg Why are you doing this?Moral of the story is shop around, man I have to say New Egg doing a bait and switch on home page to search prices on the MZ-75E500B/AM backfired.  Yeah you sold out and then got more, put an inflated price in the season to be jolly and then did a reduced....uhh inflated price to make it a deal.  I am very disappointed in newegg on this.

                Samsung documentation is utter garbage, especially went it came to migrating my OS drive on a spinning disk to this flash drive.  Documentation has no text at all and I ordered a data transfer cable based off of the picture documentation.  No issue there, the problems were encountered when I installed the software and the drive was not seen by Samsung Magician as a Samsung disk while connected via the transfer cable.  Which leads to the problem, the installation disk only installs Samsung Magician automatically, it does not install the migration tool which I didn't notice until I had given up using the data transfer cable and installed the drive on the SATA interface.  The documentation has no means of communicating that the migration tool requires manual installation and Samsung's website provided no additional insight.

The fact that there is a secondary phone number that is not public or I didn't easily find.Then the fact that I was hung up on and lied to multiple times, after waiting hours to just get through or transferred. Finally after getting a e-mail sent to me with all the RMA info and how to get the process started. It has been longer then the time they stated it would take to get me a ticket number. Thus the process hasn't even started yet.Due to the sheer frustration and fact that I still see no indication of me getting a new unit sent to me or a refund, I can no longer recommend Samsung products or will by any in the future.I am disgusted with the practices of the call center and will be posting a complaint to the BBB next.Good product, just dismal customer service.

The speeds are just fantastic. If you want hard numbers you can easily Google those, however I can tell you that on my new Skylake i7-6700 build this drive is great and pushes data as fast as the bus can take it.

                1. The migration tool wiped the old disk after the migration. I was not expecting this, and it wasn't very nice of the software to do that. It should have warned me it was going to do this - I was going to use the old disk as a backup. The migration is a one way ticket; there's no going back.2. You need a USB-SATA cable to use the migration tool. It was not included, which was a bit of a surprise as well.3. The included CD installed some ""magic"" tool that doesn't have anything to do with the migration software and doesn't appear to do anything useful.

            I've been using a 1 TB Western Digital Green drive with an OCZ Synapse cache SSD.  Seems to work great once you're in Windows, but power interruptions and sometimes a simple reboot would cause the computer to take forever rebooting.  After a recent power interruption, I had trouble getting the computer to boot up.  After messing with DataPlex, it finally booted.  Then I got the Samsung EVO 850 and did the migration and it's like a new machine.

Cons:
                Does not come with an extra SATA cable nor 2.5"" to 3.5"" bracket like it shows in the instructions.  Seems misleading.  For laptops, it shows a SATA to USB adapter to do your migration with.  It doesn't come with any of this.

            Since i'm an advanced user it might have helped if i had some advanced options for drive migration. Also not all usb to sata connectors will recognize this drive so some additional hard war purchases may be necessary. since it is a 2.5"" drive you will need to buy a mounting bracket for 3.25"" 5"" drive bays on desktop systems.

Cons:
                The software for migration is an absolute knight mare to use when something has gone wrong. It dose not like to have multiple partition drives with multiple formats. If your good with other clone software you would be better off using that,  Trying to use the provided migration software was more of a head ache than it needed to be. What i needed it to do was just a migration of the boot sectors and c: of a windows install on a 1 TB drive. even when everything was set up the way the software said i should have it the cloning would stall at 99% complete all of the time. when it finished no data was on my drive. It would not matter how much data was to be cloned. tried with a vanilla win 10 install for no luck. Kind of ironic since it was all for a Samsung laptop.

        ","
Pros:
                Everybody touts the Samsungs as the best, well they are very good at what they do, but no one can tell you what to do if you need to re-use them to make them work in another machine.$157 paperweight, when $40 120gb by someone else works just as good.
            ","
Cons:
                The RMA and support is the worst of all SSD makers, and least available info for the process. Its been 3 weeks since I called them and waiting for an email with instructions on where to return it. I was using this 500 gb in my girlfriends laptop(trying to save it for her because she is slow learner on computers-still using Vista), finally got tired of hearing about it so I bought her a new one. Trying to Salvage the SSD, I tried many things to no avail, it is not readable as a drive in any other computer. What good is a 3-10 year warranty if you can't get it.

            ","
Cons:
                My only gripe is the migration software which I hear is standard with all brands. If your old C: drive hdd that you want to replace is more than the capacity of the new ssd you must chose from music, pictures, video and other stuff to trim the size down. Only problem is I could not remove enough of those items to create enough space to do a successful migration. So I searched the web and ended up using Rufus to create a bootable o.s. and it worked like a charm within 10 minutes!

Overall Review:
            $149.99 was the Black Friday deal. That is still a good amount of coin to spend on a hard drive. I wish these would come down a little more on the price. Another thing I noticed is that these do not come with a SATA cable or a tray to mount your drive in your desktop. If you have a custom built PC that is within 5 years old, you will most likely have a tray that fits these SSD drives. Mine luckily did. I did not have to buy one. I also had a few SATA cables laying around that I always keep on hand. But for some of you, that may be a different story. If you buy this drive and do not have any spare SATA cables laying around, be sure to add one to your order along with this drive. So that when you receive your drive and open the box, you are not disappointed when you do not see a SATA cable and realize you cannot do the swap till you get a cable. For $149.99 sale price, it should come with a SATA cable. That was a sale price. Retail is over $200. Come on Samsung, at least put a cable in the box. It's a $1 part. I like Samsung products but thought that was a little cheap on their end to not include one.
        ","
Pros:
                The Samsung Data transfer software was pretty nice. It allows you to clone your main drive to the SSD. I didn't use that method though to clone my main disk. I used another type of software to clone the primary partition to the SSD. This was my first SSD. I just never took the plunge because of their high prices. You get what you pay for. Sure, I could've bought a $40 SSD but how long would've that lasted me? I read a lot of great reviews about the Samsung Pro / Evo model SSD's and saw the deal for Black Friday. I couldn't refuse. I did some research and compared some other brand name SSD's VS this Samsung 850 Evo, this by far was one of the better ones on the market. The read/write and sequential write speeds surpassed 90% of the SSD's that are on the market. My computer used to take about 1 minute to boot up from start. Now, it takes 14 seconds to get to the main desktop. It's insane on how fast everything is.

Pros:
                As stated in my review title, I'm a previous long time owner of the Samsung 830 128GB, which I loved. However, when I saw a sale for this item, I couldn't pass up a newer version with more space. I did a clean install with this drive for Windows 7 and had absolutely no issues on my either my test board Z170 or old Z68 rig. Besides the sale being the reason for getting this, when viewing the comparison on ssd.userbenchmark.com, I couldn't help but get excited at a potential 51% increase over the Samsung 830.My previous 830 128GB in bench test showed the following.Sequential TestRead: 509 MB/sWrite: 264 MB/sMixed: 263 MB/sRandom 4k Test4k Read: 23.1 MB/s4k Write: 61.9 MB/s4k Mixed: 19.6 MB/sDeep Queue 4k TestDQ Read: 243 MB/sDQ Write: 77.8 MB/sDQ Mixed: 56.7 MB/sThe new Samsung 850 EVO showed the following in bench tests.Sequential TestRead: 518 MB/s (1.76% increase)Write: 431 MB/s (63.25% increase)Mixed: 389 MB/s (47.90% increase)Random 4k Test4k Read: 42.2 MB/s (82.68% increase)4k Write: 90.2 MB/s (45.71% increase)4k Mixed: 41.2 MB/s (110.20% increase)Deep Queue 4k TestDQ Read: 267 MB/s (9.87% increase)DQ Write: 189 MB/s (142.93% increase)DQ Mixed: 110 MB/s (94% increase)Those % increases speak for themselves on justifying the upgrade. While my personal comparison above is across two different size drives (850 250GB vs 830 128GB), I'm not overly concerned with the amount of skew that offers in the results. This is evident when looking at other people's benches of 120GB 850 EVOs vs 128GB 830s.

Pros:
                Very fast drive, even by SSD standards. This drive replaced a ~4 year old OCZ Agility 3 drive that was working fine but had been getting progressively slower over the last 6 months or so.Benchmarked the OCZ drive and this drive - the Samsung posted nearly 2.5x seq read and 3x seq write, and 4-5x random read/write!!! This was done with Samsung's rapid mode turned off.  On the rapid mode feature... though the benchmarks with it turned on are incredible, I honestly did not notice any appreciable real-world difference to leave this turned on, so I turned it back off. This is more due to how fast the drive is by default, not a knock on the rapid mode feature.Can't forget that sweet Samsung 5-year warranty. Hope I never have to use it, but the peace of mind is nice. Major props to Samsung for offering this to their users.

Cons:
                I formatted the hard drive and installed OS X Yosemite onto it and then installed it into my old 2011 macbook pro.  It worked for about a week; but then one day, as I was opening Photoshop, the computer died and rebooted into a gray screen of death.  I tried several different things to get it working, but it wouldn't boot fully.  So, I formatted the drive again, and installed OS X Yosemite again.  It worked for a few minutes, and then it started rebooting whenever I tried to open an app.  Finally, it died completely again.It's definitely the hard drive, because if I put the old hard drive back into the computer, everything works fine again.

Overall Review:
            This drive was purchased to make a new cheapy HP laptop with only 4 gigs of RAM run faster, and run faster it did! I may not bump the memory to 8 gigs as it'll just be too fast. <grin>But...   note that Samsung's data migration software will not copy your recovery partition so you'll have to make other arrangements in order to be able to reload Windows from scratch in the future. And if your upgrading from W7 to W10 as I did, you'll need to do the upgrade before migration because W10 balked at the upgrade when it saw the Evo didn't contain the recovery partition. Went back and did the upgrade to W10 on the spinning drive which retained the recovery partition and then migrated everything to the Evo and it all worked. But only the boot partition migrates.
        ","
Pros:
                Replaced spinning drive in new laptop and install went pretty much flawlessly. (See Other thoughts.) Samsung software CD included migration tool and Magician but downloading same from Samsung's website yielded newer versions.

            This is not my first party, but it is the first time I've had two identical drives turn out DOA like this.  It makes me fear for the durability/longevity of the 500GB 850 EVO I have installed in my laptop.  So far, it's been perking along without a hitch but now I half expect it to fail while I'm still in the middle of writing this.  A similar-sized drive of another brand is so far working reliably in my wife's laptop.To anyone from Samsung who may actually read this: ¿Que pasa?  Could an agent from the North have slipped across the border and infiltrated/sabotaged your company?  Could you have all or part of a batch that slipped through QC in spite of having problems?  Hint: It would cost less to recall the entire batch than to lose business to ill will resulting from apparent reliance on end users to do ""field testing.""A great pity, this, because I've always liked Samsung products.  Now, however, it's ""Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.""  Fool me three times?  Sorry, but that's not about to happen: even I am capable of learning.

Tried on different machines with two different external SATA cradles, all equipment previously used successfully to prepare other drives for installation.  Windows 7 Disk Manager returned I/O error each try.  Samsung's ""Magician"" software recognized that a Samsung device was connected but couldn't do a thing with it.  Declared DOA and returned for replacement.Drive #2:  The replacement drive behaved in exactly the same way as the first.  Another DOA - from Samsung, of all outfits!

Cons:
                The only con I can report is that I didn't purchase the larger SSD, but that has nothing to with the product itself. I didn't run many benchmarks to compare this with other products like I said earlier. I just needed something to get the job done and this does it.

1402,Solid Drive,,"
Pros:
                Upgraded a mid-2012 MacBook Pro to the Samsung Evo 1tb SSD. Wow. Night and day difference. This thing absolutely rips. On the old HD, had a lot of pinwheels and things took forever to load - even with a completely fresh install. Get the occasional pinwheel, but suspect that's related to OSX and/or the processor and not seeking.Can't comment on the difference among SSDs, but Samsung seems to get consistently high ratings and reviews. The biggest difference between the Evo and Pro (for me) is the warranty. Evo has a 5-year warranty, Pro has a 10-year. They also have different controllers, but suspect the marginal speed difference there is not something I'll pick up on browsing the internet or word processing.

1403,Decent,"
Overall Review:
            Samsung 830 and 850EVO were in the same price bracket, however, the quality of the drives are worlds apart. It appears that Samsung has packaged a ""generic"" drive in their EVO series. Which remains the same price as the previous ""better"" Samsung drives. Then they packaged their regular drive into the PRO series and charge you double for what you used to get from them for MUCH cheaper.Over 3 years, Samsung quality has stayed the same, but the price has drastically gone up for said quality. The drives are either too expensive, or poorly built.
        ","
Pros:
                Good storage capacity for the price tag, which is normally discounted. Samsung 5 year warranty. Samsung Magician is useful to those new to SSD's or for those that don't want to do the research on how to tweak your OS for a SSD.

Cons:
                I purchased a Samsung 830 back in 2012, and it was amazingly fast. 3 years later I ""upgraded"" to the 850, only to get a slower drive. One would think after 3 years Samsung would make their drives to be faster, not just larger. No 3.5 adapter, not many come with that, so no biggie

After playing Witcher 3 for 1 1/2 weeks it crashed again (lost everything again).  That was a common problem with SSD's from three years ago.  Decided not to give up on the tech, that by now they have to be making better products and purchased this drive on sale (almost $40 less than another Corsair).    I have been using the drive for almost two weeks and Witcher3 has not blown it out yet.Also, Corsair said their was 20 days left on my warranty and they will send me a new SSD.

It is simply now the fastest machine she has ever used. And we are heavy use/serious multitasking people (so NO, we don't just email and cruise Facebook...we actually do WORK on our machines). Her boot time to login screen used to be about 2 minutes. Now it's about 12 seconds. From login screen to desktop screen and actually be able to open ANYTHING was about 8 minutes.

                doesn't come with a sata to usb adapter. While the installation guide shows a transfer cable to do the full drive transfert, the box doesn't contain it but worst never say anywhere that it dosn't come with the box. For my part, since I knew what I was buying and I also already had that kind of adapter it wasn't really a problem, but less tech savvy customer could think that something is missing or at least that it should have come in the box instead of telling you after you bought the drive your missing something which would be an assle to order since you already waited for the drive by mail in the first place

                This is not the first SSD I bought from Samsung. For my desktop, I bought a 840 EVO and it still works wonders after 2-3 years after use.

Thankfully, I don't need to do it after seeing the results of this SSD on my laptop. I never knew how much heat my 7200 HDD produced until I replaced it with this even with my Cool Master Laptop Cool Pad ($50/large/heavy/loud) running at full blast. After playing WoW and SC2 for three hours back to back, I realized my laptop was still cool when it should normally be very hot after a hour.I tested this again with my laptop cooler at low settings and it's still cool to play.I should have done this three years ago instead of building a whole new desktop just to play my video games due to the heat of my laptop. For those who play games on their laptops, I really do recommend replacing your HDD with a SSD once your warranty expires. The difference is very noticeable in terms of heat, read, and write.I will definitely buy this again should a situation arises.

I've removed the drive, put the old OCZ back in and it's working like a dream.Samsung has made their RMA process impossible.  I was given a link for an XMA, and upon submission I get an error that states ""this page doesn't exist.""  I've sent e-mails through the form on their website and gotten no response.  The RMA form on their website does not list this model number, and in fact under the pull down under ""EVO SSDs"" there are no options to choose, and no way to continue.  There is no contact e-mail address on their website.  There is a ""Samsung EVO"" facebook page, I've only gotten a run around on there, a non-functioning XMA form and a link to the UK support site (I clearly stated I'm from the USA, and the support site is worthless).

Overall Review:
            If your motherboard does not have any Sata III ports the performance increase provided by the SSD will not be as great, but your computer will still be considerably faster than your old hard drive. If you plan on migrating your current operating system to an SSD you will need a USB 3 dongle that includes a SATA connection for the drive. These are available from Newegg, but are not included with the drive. I have utilized Casper software to migrate the operating system from a hard drive to an SSD. I have also loaded a clean version of Windows 7 to an SSD. Both times the process was painless and the SSD sure does take a lot less time to load all of the post SP1 Windows 7 updates. I haven't tried one of these drives in a laptop, but the performance increase should be significant since there are a lot of laptops out there utilizing 5400 rpm hard drives. In addition, the battery should last longer since the SSD uses less electricity than a spinning platter hard drive.
        ","
Pros:
                It took me a long time to make the move to an SSD. When prices finally came down I bought a Samsung 840 EVO and would never consider going back. That 840 EVO is still working perfectly in my main computer. I recently purchased two 850 EVO's one for my HTPC the other for my daughter's business computer. With an SSD bootup speed decreases, programs open faster, and your general computing experience improves. I use the ""maximum reliability"" setting in the Samsung Magician software since I favor longevity over the slight speed boost you may get from ""maximum performance."" I don't use the ""rapid mode"" since the reviews on it are mixed. I do utilize a Ramdisk for my IE cache to reduce writes to the SSD.

                I needed more space than the current 60GB Samsung 830 Pro had so this was ordered.

I extended the boot volume to use a bit more of the 250G.Windows says this drive is a little faster than the 3.5yo drive, which was expected.  I've had great luck with Samsung over the years and expect the same quality product from this purchase.

Overall Review:
            How can you go wrong with this drive?  The price is great, the thing will last even much longer than they quote (there have been tests...) and magician software is even helpful.  RAPID is a cool concept if you've got some RAM to spare.  Basically turns this single SSD in to an SSD RAID-0 feel by using RAM as cache, just like RAID cards do.If you're thinking about the Pro vs this model, the only differences are the Pro has a 3-core controller vs this model's 2 core, the Pro is provisioned to the full capacity (512 vs 500) and the Pro has the longer warranty.  Will you feel any difference with the pro in a home rig?  NO.  In a high end workstation where this drive is going to take a beating for long periods of time (autocad and other specific use cases) the Pro could be worth it as it will yield lower latency, likely works better in RAID arrays (though you should be looking at the SM951 these days) and is quoted to last longer.

            I have purchased around 7 of these drives for multiple PC builds. From 120-500gb and I love these drives. My personal PC can reboot in about 27 seconds from the time to click restart to the time my desktop is fully loaded from a user login. I have had 1 drive fail that needed to be replaced via samsung and their support was not bad just hard to communicate with. I never got any real follow up or confirmation emails, but the new drive showed up when expected.These perfrom better than the OCZ drives underload in identical machines. The software to config the drive from samsung is pretty awesome as well and really shows off the drives potential. If you are not going to use the samsung software and just want to slap this puppy in and go, its performance is pretty much on par with all the other drives.

You can find rubber spacers online for $2-$3, but that doesn't help when you're ready to install the drive and don't have it.  I really wish Samsung had included one, or at least clearly stated that it was not included.  I docked a star for that.  They probably cost a few pennies to manufacture, and it would make life just a little easier for end users.

            Samsung SSDs are said to have no trouble with mainboards using Intel Rapid Storage drivers.  (Be sure to use the latest RST too.)  I've found this drive the best alternative to the more expensive Crucial MX series drives.  They are awesome too.

The samsung cloning software seeings the flagged blocks and stops cloning. This makes migration much harder than intended. Rather than buy a copy of arconis, I just did a fresh reinstall.

            Overall I am extremely happy with this drive.  Samsung needs to fix the migration software, but if you can successfully  migrate your data you will be pleased with the performance.
        ","
Pros:
                This drive substantially improved the performance of my laptop.  I installed this drive in a Intel I7 Toshiba S55-B5268 with 12GB of RAM, running windows 8.1.  I was having problems with the disk utilization maxing out at 100% and sluggish performance.  I installed this drive, migrated from my HDD (more on this latter) and am amazed at how much better my laptop runs.  After I optimized the drive for my system (Using the Samsung software) my wake up time is a few seconds and my boot time was reduced by over 2 minutes.
            ","
Cons:
                The migration software that comes with this product is poor.  It does the job, but like many other reviews my migration stalled for hours at the 100% mark.  The system kept saying not responding on the software, however I noticed that every minute or so it would advance the clock on the migration software by a few seconds.  This indicated that it constantly switching from not responding to running (most of the time not responding).  I decided to let it go and 4 hours later it finished the migration.  Total time to migrate around 550GB was around 10-12 hours.  Also the kit does not come with a spacer to install this 7 millimeter drive in 9.5 millimeter bays.  Suppose this could be a user responsibility but my last SSD came with one.

I was playing world of warcraft and was getting fed up with objects/people phasing into my view distance.  Most people think this is lag but it is actually the objects loading off your hard drive slowly after the your pc knows thye object should be there.Anyways this drive completely fixed that phasing issue and makes the game feel like I am playing on a brand new PC.  I am blown away at the performance change this made to the game.I started warcraft on my PC and my wife's PC at the same time.  I was in the game with all objects loaded and she had not even started the load bar yet.This was my first experience with a SSD and more of a personal experiment to see if they are worth the money.

1530,One of the best on the market.,"
Overall Review:
            While I know it's a ridiculously fast and very reliable drive, I really didn't notice much improvement with my computer overall, between loading Windows and games... maybe it saves me a few seconds here and there... but it's no lightning speed like most ppl hype SSDs to be, not even close. It's not the drive's fault or whether or not I set the drive up properly, cuz I did... I followed all the procedures to maximize the performances and the bench tests confirm it's crazy speeds. It's likely just the rest of the computer holding it back when loading stuff. I'm just glad I waited this long to officially own my first SSD when the prices finally became reasonable.PC: Asus M4A89GTD PRO, AMD X4 965 @ 4GHz with Aftermarket cooler, 4x2GB DDR3 ram 1600MHz 9-9-9-24, GTX 660 S2 3GB, Win7

                - Based on my extensive research, it's one of the best drives on the market (best one being the Pro version of this drive), and it's surprisingly cheaper than some of the other drives too probably because of them being high in demand.

Pros:
                I recently put together a new machine, choosing to go with an SSD instead of retaining my older 500GB 10,000rpm WD Raptor drive. This drive is running very well, is extremely fast overall, even more so in Windows 10, and has cut my boot time down to 2 seconds on a cold start. It is a great buy at it's current price point of $179.99, which is the same price I paid for it. I would highly recommend this drive to anyone looking for a fast, reliable SSD with a great warranty.

1535,SSD Died? Really?,"
Overall Review:
            For anybody thinking of getting an SSD. Do it. Just make sure you create a crash plan, these things are not as reliable as they claim to be. As for repairing them, good luck. We found that the main controller had failed. It wasn't a solder issue but the chip it's self, just dead. We had to buy another, replace the chip then spend hours scouring the drive for information. Unfortunately this chip resets the drives cache switches so it deleted everything. In short, if this drive fails don't waste money on expensive recovery options, unless it is a simple solder issue chances are very high that the information will be un-recoverable.

Cons:
                One of the Computers I built in the last year died suddenly with no warning at all of impending doom. This was 7 months after it entered service. There was a raid array for file backups, but the user decided to turn off backup and restore because Samsung drives are rated for 1 million plus hours. Well we got less than 30k hours out of it. Here is my big problem. Obviously I build computers and work on lots of them, so when a drive with valuable data crashes we want to know why and see if it is repairable. By deciding to look at why this drive has crashed we voided the warranty. Samsung wont repair the faulty drive so what am I supposed to do? We have valuable data on that drive. Why do I have to take the hit for this failure because Samsung cant stand behind their product when it fails?

I have Win10 set to automatic login so its just a matter of seconds from turning on my rig to getting to my desktop with all my startup programs already loaded. I have zero regrets on this SSD.

Pros:
                Extremely fast. This is my first SSD. I've always used mechanical drives so the difference at first impression was tremendous. I set all my programs such as Steam / Origin / AMD Gaming Evolved / Battlenet / Teamspeak on top of my other startup programs and to put it simply, they are all ready as soon as you log into Windows. Also, some games such as CS:GO, Battlefield 4 for example, do load faster when installed on the SSD.

Cons:
                It's a bare drive. I had extra screws and all-purpose brackets for my tower to accommodate the SSD but you should probably buy extra screws if you don't have, as this hard drive comes with no other accessories aside from the SSD.

            Samsung's instructions do not mention having to change the boot options (F12 on Dell) when using UEFI and a secure boot BIOS. Plus the drive installs without all of its high speed features enabled.  You have to manually enable them using the Samsung Magician SW.   The included Samsung Data Migration SW did move my Win 8.1 HD to the SSD.I purchased the 500 MB Samsung 850 EVO instead of the 1TB drive to update a laptop and I assume this drive will use slightly less power as there is 1/2 of the RAM on board.  The reviews I checked did not show a difference in standby power between EVO and PRO models.  I hope that's true for use on my laptop.

Pros:
                Installed this drive in a Dell Inspiron 15 7548 Laptop.  Formats to 464 GB.  Used Samsung Data Migration SW to copy my existing HD with Win 8.1.  Then you have to use Samsung Magician SW to enable high speed features including a RAM disk buffer.  Note the RAM disk buffer uses part of your system memory.
            ","
Cons:
                The first time you boot this drive Dell's BIOS give us a ""No Bootable Device Found"" error.  You must use (F12) Boot Options to tell the system to boot from the SSD for the first time.  Bios Settings (F2) do not show an option to boot from the SSD.  Worked with Dell Chat Session and verified we can't change boot options using the BIOS.  They recommended booting from a recovery USB stick and reloading Win 8.1.  When you insert the USB stick to boot, you have to hit Boot Options (F12), and then there is a choice to boot from the SSD!  So we didn't need a recovery disk to reload the OS :)

1560,Not supported by AMD onboard RAID,"
Overall Review:
            I plan on buying a hardware RAID card to move my RAID 1 array off of the onboard SATA ports, so I can change them to AHCI. I did to one test run with RAID off and AHCI on, and the SSD performed very fast. I didn't do any tests with numbers or whatever, but I did use the computer how I normally would and noticed a dramatic increase in performance.
        ","
Pros:
                FastStores data
            ","
Cons:
                My AMD motherboard supports hardware RAID, but the onboard RAID controller doesn't support this SSD. It won't even work if I make the SSD a single disk, which was my plan. I have an existing RAID 1 array, and that's the only reason I even have RAID on. So now, my new SSD and my current OS SSD are both plugged into non-RAID SATA ports, but I can only make them IDE emulated, so they're running slower than they could. Not really Samsung's fault, more the fault of AMD and their basic RAID controller. Just watch out for that.

1561,Best upgrade of my five-and-a-half-year-old build,"
Overall Review:
            Whether you're using a computer that old (like the one that I have from 2010) or building a new Skylake system (even though they're touting PCIe SSD support A LOT!), this SSD is the best choice for most people.At first, I was concerned that I might be using the SSD too much that I could wear it out before the five-year warranty is up...but since then, it has dropped down to much more acceptable levels. The endurance level is so high you'd be writing to the SSD 80GB/day every day to reach the 150TB endurance rating in five years! Most people like me don't write to the SSD 80GB/day (I used up roughly twice as much in the first day to install the OS and the applications, but I think that's the only time you'll be doing such a lot of writes in one day), so the 850 EVO should be fine for most users (despite the fact we've got faster SSDs, such as the 850 PRO and Intel's 750, at a much higher price while, in my opinion, doesn't accelerate as much in turning on the computer, using everyday applications and turning off the computer; it would only benefit in content-creating applications such as Adobe's Creative Suite of programs). (Even when I'm using BitTorrent when my computer is idle, the SSD doesn't write very much! Right now, my total amount of data written to the SSD is less than the 80GB daily average.)My boot times for my computer, though, were roughly the same as without SSD (or marginally better), but I think it's because I have too much hard drives connected, and it may be because of the older platform.Overall, this is the upgrade I've been waiting for way too long. I've been using the 840 EVO SSD on my laptop, and it changed how I used my laptop, so why not my desktop computer? I've been really wanting this SSD for months, despite the age of my computer, and finally I am proud to be a very highly satisfied customer of the 850 EVO. Highly recommended, whether you're tired of using an HDD as an OS drive and need the extra kick of responsiveness of an SSD, or building your next dream computer build.My system specs: Core i7-860 (P55), 16GB DDR3 RAM, GTX 980, 3500GB of additional internal storage HDDs, 8500GB of additional external storage HDDs.
        ","
Pros:
                Probably this is the best upgrade I've done throughout my past five and a half years using my custom built computer (Core i7-860!). I've been upgrading throughout the recent years, from more storage hard drives, to system memory (maxed out at 16GB) and graphics card (GTX 980!), but nothing changed my computing experience than this 850 EVO SSD I bought. Simply put, this is the best SSD to choose for most people.Simply put: This upgrade has made my computer MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE than what it had been without using an SSD. Even if the computer that I'm using was from 2010!I know, there are much faster SSDs out there (especially those PCIe/NVMe SSDs)...but they're not so signifcant in terms of improving speed on everyday tasks, such as web browsing. These drives are much more suitable for content creation. Personally, the 850 EVO has pretty much sufficient performance necessary for most people, so this is the best value out there. Samsung Magician software is a plus, and so too the five-year warranty (most other drives in this segment have, say, three - or even two (!) - year warranties).
            ","
Cons:
                None so far. My motherboard is from 2010 that does NOT have 6Gb/s SATA ports, so the performance isn't as fast as, say, one with such ports, but that's a motherboard issue, not the SSD.

Pros:
                This drive is fast! Benchmark speeds come extremely close to matching advertised transfer rates without RAPID enabled. This drive was used to upgrade my desktop's OS HDD from a 7200 1TB Seagate Barracuda and is also my first SSD. I am running a 3.4 GHz i7-2600k and 8GB of DDR3 1333MHz RAM. My boot times are 15 seconds or less and everything is instantly responsive. I checked the drive for bad sectors from the start and everything came back clean and running great since day 1. Anyone looking for a massive speed boost in their computer should definitely consider one of these. I do not regret my purchase one bit. When I open a program, it's there immediately. When I see the desktop on boot, it's ready to go that instant, no waiting for services to load. I will definitely be using these for future builds.

            After installing Samsung Magician and running the performance test I was disappointed to see that I was only getting two-thirds of the advertised random read/write speeds.

Samsung gets around this little fact by advertising ""up to"".  A bit deceptive if you ask me.

I have multiple drives in my computer so I went into the bios and selected another drive with Window 10 Pro, and it loaded right away. I have an ASUS board with the latest BIOS. There is some issue with these drives. I hope someone from samsung could clear up what causes this. MBR and everything in windows diagnostics showed it was all fine, so not like I had corrupted files on the drive. Btw this rarely happens on shutdown, so i always shutdown my computer, it is more likely to happen during a restart. Either way you are at risk for it not booting.

Overall Review:
            I've purchased 3 of these over the last six months and have not been disappointed. On my first purchase I was replacing a dying OCZ REVOPCIE SSD (absolutely the fastest drive I've ever seen), so this SATA SSD is noticeably somewhat slower, but still better than a platter. And half the price of the REVO.The first one I purchased came with the Magician software requiring the SSD to be linked to the PC via a USB to SATA cable only or it would not see it! I could have spent the 8 bucks to get this cable but when would I ever use it again? Never. I have ESATA ports for that.But the REVO had too many bad sectors to even get Acronis to clone it, so I did a fresh OS install instead. The other two came with a newer version of Magician that allowed me to plug the SSD into an internal SATA port like normal and cloned from platter to it.Perfect!My advice: Newegg is a great site and customer service here is fantastic. The free shipping sucks. It's DHL ""business days - no weekends"" shipping and when it finally arrives SOMEWHERE, ANYWHERE in your state they pass it off to the USPS. That's right, the good old snail mail service delivers it just as quickly as they do everything else.Best thing to do is shop for it here on Newegg, read the reviews and compare products. Then go to (they censor the ""A"" word here but it's the mega online retailer named after the South American river) and buy it. This drive is there now for 15 bucks less and even their free UPS shipping is half the time of DHL.

Overall Review:
            After purchasing this, I then read a lot of the reviews, a lot of which are negative towards the supplier and the shipping errors so I figured I would chime in.Ordered this on a Monday, got it in the mail (USPS) on Friday; the estimate was slated for Saturday. I live on the East coast, and it was shipped from the West coast. They said ""5-7 business days"" and that's what I got, so honestly I cannot complain.Furthermore, mine worked like a charm after having just built a new computer (it was the last part I needed to hook up to my computer, all the other pieces (mobo, PSU, etc) arrived Wednesday).What I will say, though its mostly food for thought, is that is does come in a small bubble padded yellow envelope and that it DOES NOT come with any SATA cables.I didn't mind the packaging, as it was not damaged or tarnished in any way, and I did not need a SATA cable because several came with my new PSU.

Pros:
                bought this drive to increase speed when booting windows and running programs and it did just that.   First I upgraded my hdd to windows 10 using the free upgrade option from my oem pre installed windows 7Than downloaded the windows 10 media creation tool from Microsoft and burned the proper ISO.  Removed the hdd and replaced with new Evo ssd.   Booted from the windows 10 cd I made and it installed like a charm requiring no license keys because the upgrade license links to your motherboard and cpu. After the fresh install of windows 10 on the ssd, it takes longer to get through my 5 second posted  delay than it does to start windows.  Turning on the computer for the first time literally takes about 7 seconds minus the 5 second delay I put on myself.    Great drive so far

            I have prior experience with an 840 EVO drive in one of my HTPC's.  This unit was running Windows 8.1 when I installed the drive and Samsung's software performed like a champ. Still plays nice now that I have upgraded to Windows 10.

Cons:
                First one was DOA. Second one works, but not without significant issues with Samsung's included software. The Samsung Migration Utility does not recognize the drive on any of my four Windows 10 systems (two notebooks running Home and two HTPC's running Premium). Further, these drives don't seem to play well with all USB caddys.  The first one I used was a BYTECC USB3 caddy. Windows 10 reported that the drive failed to initialize on all four computers. An old Toshiba USB2 worked and I was able to use Acronis True Image to clone my drive. I didn't bother with the Samsung Magician software. I'll wait until a version that plays nice with Windows 10 comes along.

1599,Not recommended,"
Overall Review:
            The serious performance slowdown issue of the 840-nonpro, 840-EVO, and possibly 850-EVO should really be handled with a recall program. They tried to fix it with firmware, but it doesn't work. I wouldn't be surprised to see this issue turn into a class action.
        ","
Pros:
                Specs on paper are good, especially the 4k random read (single queue), which is essential for fast desktop performance. 5 years warranty also sound good.
            ","
Cons:
                I bought this 850 EVO to replace an aging 840 EVO SSD, which had horrible drops in performance despite the newest firmware. HDtune read rate on the old 840 was very uneven and maybe as lows as 10% of what it should be, so the new 850 EVO should be much better, right? Yes, it was better, but not as good as other new SSDs. I tested the 850 EVO drive with both AS-SSD and HDtune, once after writing it half full of data, and once after a secure erase. After I had copied over 250GB of data via disk imaging, the performance of the 850 EVO in HDtune was uneven, showing a significant drop (maybe 50%) in read rate when reading the logical blocks with freshly written data, and full speed only on the empty portions of the HDD. Next, I did a secure erase and tested again - this time, the read rate was good across the entire (all empty) disk. Note, however, when I tested a BX100 and some other recent SSDs, they were able to maintain the same full performance read speed in HDtune regardless of whether they were full of data or freshly secure erased. Basically, the EVO will slow down once you write actual data to it. This was a huge problem for the 840 EVO, and while the issue has been improved with the 850 EVO, the slowdown issue is still not completely gone. And this is fresh out of the box! Basically, I don't trust any TLC drives anymore, and I am returning my 850 EVO to NewEgg after this find.What make matters worse is Samsung's really bad RMA process, which you need to utilize once you are out of exchange privileges with NewEgg. I am trying to have my 840 EVO exchanged through Samsung, but RMA for Samsung SSDs goes through a 3rd party company. Samsung's own RMA website (they call it XRA) is broken when you hit the submit button. Instead, you need to find the 3rd party company totalts.com which is difficult to locate to begin with, and which hasn't responded in a week. NewEgg is very helpful with its support, but Samsung's 5 year warranty is useless if you can't actually reach anyone to exercise it. So now I don't trust Samsung's SSD, TLC memory in general, and Samsung's RMA process in particular. Buyer beware.

I don't have the numbers, but the load times in the few titles I tested (MGS:PP and Battlefield 4, specifically) have increased astronomically. I don't have numbers in front of me, but a guesstimate on loading a BF4 map from the storage drive probably jumped by 1-2 minutes.The Magician software is nice, too. Compared to the essentially non-existent OCZ software, Samsung is light years ahead of the curve.I've read all the negative reviews, and aside from a couple DOAs, early failure, and compatibility issues, the consensus is this is a great upgrade/new build drive.

Pros:
                I am a real estate photographer and my business depends upon producing dozens of very high resolution images a day. I regularly process over 500 38mp RAW files through Adobe Lightroom and an application Enfuse in a day, to produce 60 to 90 production marketing images for my clients. This is after shooting all day - I process the images at night. Before I got my EVO 850 I was regularly working until 1am getting those files ready to give to my clients first thing in the morning. Now I am in bed most nights after Fallon's monologue! This drive enabled me to step up to the next level in production - I can shoot more homes in a day and not be worried about not getting any sleep before I have to get up and do it all over again. In the three weeks since I installed it, I have made easily 25% more than I did in the previous month. I have knocked off that much time from my workflow. I'm going to get another for my desktop computer when I have time to migrate to it. Hopefully the price will drop even more by then!

                The software that came with this drive is totally worthless. I found a free cloning software that took care of my transfer of my hard disk.

Acronis failed, too, for that matter, and after researching the problem I found that neither application supports UEFI hard disks.

        ","
Pros:
                This is a top tier consumer drive.  I purchased 2 of these to replace laptop hard drives for family members.  One used SATA3 on an AMD A8 laptop and after performing the read/write test with the Samsung Magician software the results matched the advertised read/write speeds.  The other Laptop was SATA2 and performed as expected, I do not have the exact numbers.The Magician software is among the better software provided by SSD manufactures with all of the normal tools you would need to maintain and monitor your drive's health and performance.
            ","
Cons:
                I had attempted to use the Samsung Migration software using and external USB3 drive dock.  The software never recognized the external drive and after some research online you need to ensure you have a basic USB to SATA adapter with no additional features like hot swap. It will not recognize the drive.  The instructions that came with the device are also very poor. It's just pictures with really no instructions at all. This could be greatly improved or not even included and just a reference to online documentation.

Overall Review:
            Notes to future buyers:-The 2.5"" drive fits PCs AND most laptops.-Does NOT come with any wires.-DO use the Samsung Magician software! (RAPID mode is awesome!)-If you do use RAPID mode I recommend minimum 16GB RAM regardless of what it says (it allocates RAM to do its magic).-RAPID mode will only work with ONE drive.-Make sure you have AHCI enabled (NOT IDE or RAID) for best performance (The setting is usually in BIOS, if you have a somewhat new MB or laptop with no option it may be enabled by default).-Make sure you plug it in the SATA III port in you PC if you have multiple (some boards have a combo of SATA II and SATA III).-If you use any data migration to transfer Windows ensure you have Recovery\Repair media or the Windows DVD itself (it may need to repair  the boot up process).

            With the high quality and low prices of SSD's and their blazing fast performance in so many aspects of what a pc needs to do I will never buy another HDD again. Once the proces drop even more the so-so fast 1T HDD I have will get shelved as well. Even fast HDD's are bottle necks in so many aspects and you dont even know it until you see what freaky fast SSD read/writes can do for your O/S.
        ","
Pros:
                Was thinking about building new pc for gaming but was on the fence about spending $1200 when my HP Envy 17 j044ca seemed to be getting me decent fps in mmo's like GW2 so at the advice of a friend I spend some money on an SSD. Once I finally got this thing running I was stunned at the speed my laptop booted. After a clean install the boot time is literally 6 seconds! Everything is so quick now as well.. programs open in the blink of an eye... even my internet browsing is lightening fast now I guess because the cache is loaded so insanely fast now. It just sped up the whole machine more than I thought it would. Breathed new life into my laptop for a few more years I suspect. No need to spend more money at this time on another system.
            ","
Cons:
                For some reason.... Samsung has been unable to fix a bug in their included software. When I plug the SSD into the USB with the adapter I spent $20 on... the computer sees it.. I can put files on it and remove them etc... but Samsung's very own cloning software wont see the SSD drive. I read about this bug online. So... thanks to this I was unable to clone my HDD and had to find a USB key, download windows 10 image.. create a bootable usb, mess with my bios and install windows onto the SSD after putting it where the HDD was. Now I have to hunt for and download so many drivers and set everything up again :( For this... you suck samsung.. how hard of a bug can that be to fix? I'm a developer... it aint hard. NO excuse for that a month into 10's release. I love your SSD but you lost an egg because of your annoying bug that caused me a nightmare. Part of the reason I went with Samsung was because I read so many reviews raving about the cloning software... and I got effed on that part.

Overall Review:
            I bought the OZ Agility 3 as a free upgrade from a standard hard drive about 4 years ago, before everyone knew of the high failure rate for the cards, and the company went under. I was lucky that mine didn't fail, however, I periodically encountered BSOD when running my computer for an extended period of time, or when watching a few hours of video stored on the drive. So far the card feels like a big step up. The extra space (128gb vs 500gb) is nice.

Pros:
                No BSOD. (Big problem with my old Agility 3)All my games load instantly. Those same games took at least 2 or 3 seconds on my Agility 3.Didn't install Samsung software, works flawlessly out of the box. Doesn't get stuck on Windows 7 logo for 20 seconds.

            With multiple SSDs it seems motherboards don't always know which drive to boot from.  In a mechanical drive array the boards searched for one with a bootable operating system.

Pros:
                I bought this to upgrade my high-end workstation used for 3D art rendering like Maya, ZBrush, etc. It replaced my Samsung 830 Pro and also my HDD used for storage of content files. So far, I have been very pleased with the results, it seems faster than the 830 Pro for most all uses and large enough for use without another mechanical drive. Be advised, it's NOT as fast as the Intel PCIe based SSD drives, but those only have 1TB maximum capacity. I chose capacity over the fastest available due to the fact it made my work faster regardless by replacing the HDD. Sites such as Toms Hardware and PCper have great reviews on this item in technical detail that I would recommend.The warranty is greater with the 2TB 850 Pro, but I only need 5 years, beyond that it doesn't matter for me. Also, at this time, the 2TB 850 EVO has the slight edge in reviews. Bottom line is HIGHLY recommended.

Overall Review:
            Did exactly what I'd hoped by reducing (in fact, eliminating) those times when some background process (never did find out exactly what) had the mechanical HDD endlessly churning away and slowing the computer to a crawl.  Those disk-intensive tasks (e.g., virus scans, software installations/removals)  that I initiate manually are now dealt with in the blink of an eye.

Pros:
                Boot and program launch times are now faster, but not by all that much on my SATA II laptop.  Shutdown and going to sleep are now *much* faster.  Samsung Magician software worked flawlessly.  An overall improvement, enough so that I don't feel compelled to take my time running benchmarks, would cheerfully repeat the purchase and am now considering doing so for my wife's laptop.  *See ""other thoughts.*

            I installed this as my main SSD and moved my 840 Pro into my laptop.  Other than having to move this to my secondary SATA controller which has less performance than my main one I am pretty happy with this purchase.  On the secondary controller it performs slightly under benchmarks but I could get to work on the main if I wanted to break my RAID drive.

        ","
Pros:
                I got it on sale for about $230 (CAD) with free shipping. There's more space than just a 120GB or 240GB SSD. It's made by a well known name (Samsung) and comes with 5 year limited warranty. It also includes Samsung's software to benchmark, optimize, and migrate the SSD, and (unlike other companies) the software is well made and doesn't seem like it's written by some 12 year old kid.

Pros:
                I've been waiting for a 2TB SSD for years. If you do any video editing or content creation 1TB is not enough and spinning hard drives are too slow.

The drive functions just like the 1TB EVO 840, but obviously has twice as much space. The long warranty is a plus and makes the stupid high price a little more tolerable. Just a little.

Overall Review:
            Replaced the HDD in a HP Envy 15 x360 laptop running Windows 8.1 with this SSD.  Samsung included a CD with a Data Migration tool, which I had to first install on the HDD since the laptop does not include an optical drive. The Data Migration tool initially failed to clone the HDD to the SSD, but provided a error code that I could look up the problem on Samsung's website. Per the website, I moved the USB connection to the SSD from the laptop's USB 3.0 port to a 2.0 port, and the migration ran without any further issues. I then registered the device (5 year warranty), and downloaded the Samsung Magician application to optimize the SSD and OS settings, and test performance. I configured my SSD for maximum reliability and enabled RAPID mode. My particular results are the following. (Your results may vary, depending on the hardware or your laptop.)Sequential Read (MB/s): 3035Sequential Write (MB/s): 2128Random Read (IOPS): 71588Random Write (IOPS): 44576

Overall Review:
            I used Samsung's Data Migration software to setup my SSD and transfer data from my WD1002FAEX hard drive. From reading the comments/complaints about Samsung's Data Migration software, I fully expected to encounter problems. Nope - it worked flawlessly, no runs, no hits, no errors. For those who have complained about this software ""freezing"", stopping, or failing to complete. In some cases, you may have been a bit impatient with the software doing its thing. I watched the process for awhile, and noted it appear to 'stop"". I just relaxed, walked away and let it do what it was designed to do, and it did.To get the max performance out of this SSD, use the RAPID mode. My PC took 16 seconds from the appearance of the ASUS BIO screen to reach the Windows Logon screen. But, I didn't install this SSD to see how fast I could boot up my system. I have large MS Outlook PST databases, and occasionally run the compaction process to improve performance. With a standard hard drive, this could take up to four or more minutes, depending on the condition of the database. With my Samsung SSD? About 4 - 6 seconds. My games? Watchdogs, Metro 2033, Far Cry 3, Dishonored - all load and perform noticeably faster.UPDATE (of a previous review I left in June) – this is worth reading, folks:I was pretty pleased with the jump in performance I received after installing this drive, but was puzzled by the Samsung Magician’s Performance Benchmark’s figures:Random Read/Write: 194323/92231Sequential Read/Write: 6466/5244Now, I’m technically savvy enough to know that these figures were bogus, and I planned to look at this issue later.THEN – after a month, for whatever reason, my Windows 7 Update file became seriously corrupted (no, I don’t blame my Samsung drive).  I could no longer install any additional Windows updates.  With the Windows 10 upgrade coming, I ended up working with Microsoft’s Tier 1 & Tier 2 Support over a three day period to resolve the issue.  After several attempts, they eventually downloaded an entire new copy of Windows 7 Ultimate for me to re-install.The installation went fine, I was able to install all of the new Windows 7 updates, and all was well…And then it got interesting. Samsung Magician’s Performance Benchmark decided it was going to give me TRUE performance figures, as follows:Random Read/Write: 369/391Sequential Read/Write: 65564/46905Ouch! Way too slow - I repeatedly went through every possible system setting that I could change to increase performance, but I could barely get the performance up to 403/378 on the random/sequential Read/Write.  Something was wrong, because this drive can do so much better performance-wise, I have SATA III ports, and I used a new, top rated OKGEAR GC18AUBM12  SATA III cable from Newegg…I was thinking about calling Samsung Support, but before I did that, I decided to verify I had my SATA connection in the right port per the ASUS mobo manual.No, I didn’t install it in the correct port; I wa

Overall Review:
            Installed in a MacBook Pro early 2011 running dual boot Bootcamp Win7 with OSX.Be aware that Apple purposely cripples the Bootcamp setup so that Windows 7 will NOT enable AHCI support - you're running in IDE mode at half speed so that everything seems faster on the OSX side: 250 Mb/s read/write on Win7, 500-550 read/write with an OSX boot. Yes, I know there are ways to hack around this, but the price of potential instability and no sleep mode when you close the cover is too high to pay for me. When I need fast disk I/O, like running Adobe CC for uncompressed video editing, I boot into OSX.You just can't go wrong buying a Samsung SSD.

Overall Review:
            This drive comes with the drive, a ""Quick-start"" guide with cartoon guides for setting the drive up on a laptop OR desktrop, a warranty statement in umpteen languages and a disc with Samsung Magician and a more in-depth manual.There are NO mounting brackets or adapters, and there is NO SATA cable, and if you plan to clone a drive, there is NO USB adapter, you cannot use an external encasing. Have these on hand if you want to install when you get your shipment (Or better yet, order them with the drive!)Samsung Magician is totally optional. On SATA III without it you'll get advertised read/write speeds! WITH Magician, you'll not only meet them almost consistently, you can easily EXCEED them! (A previous reviewer has stated by ~50%).HOWEVER, Samsung Magician is finnicky software, and in fact, the drive itself is finnicky.But more on that in a second, let's go through my install process:Installed the drive, checked BIOS, it was all good. It automatically set the drive to IDE. This came back later.I did a clean install of my brand new (Free) copy of Windows 10, formatting my current 1TB WD Green HDD, and installing to the SSD. The installation was complete in less than 30 minutes, with ME as the bottleneck.It booted fine, drivers installed well, updates went without a hitch.Then my system crashed.I installed Samsung Magician and it reported everything was okay, but notified me: ""You're using this drive in IDE mode, and not AHCI. To get the best performance, we recommend AHCI mode.""Was this significant? Yes. I tried all sorts of drive settings and optimizations in Magician. My system would keep crashing periodically.I troubleshooted for two hours before I finally decided to switch the drive to AHCI. This is tangly. If you installed Windows on IDE, and change the BIOS to AHCI, Windows will not want to boot. It's set to load IDE drivers and never even look at AHCI drivers to optimize your booting. Your PC WILL NOT BOOT if you change your drive to AHCI after installing Windows with the drive in IDE.A safe mode boot after switching to AHCI solves this.However, that was in fact the issue. I left my PC on overnight to test and I came back to it humming away when I woke up.The same problem can be caused by other things too. They SAY that Samsung Magician, and sometimes that the drive itself, does not play well with AMD chipsets, and having an AMD FX6300, I can confirm this. As mentioned above, on IDE mode without Magician, on an AMD mobo, my PC would crash after roughly 30 minutes. But in other cases, AHCI mode or not, the drive crashes because of Samsung Magician! It's the same problem, but there are several solutions.Do yourself a favor and make sure you switch whatever SATA port(s) your put this drive on to AHCI BEFORE you install Windows, no matter your chipset (Intel or AMD). In some cases it's the difference between the drive functioning or not, and in others it just straight-up increases the dri

Pros:
                - Faster than any hard drive, only SSD I've seen that's faster is the same model in PRO form.- POST to Windows desktop in 5 seconds or less (On SATA II!)- Works well with or without Samsung Magician (See Other Thoughts for more info)- Shipped in one business day. ONE. Impressive as ever!
            ","
Cons:
                - Samsung Magician CAN be a nightmare (See Other Thoughts for more info)- Depending on your chipset, this drive might just not work for no other reason than ""It doesn't like your motherboard"".- Troubleshooting can take awhile, due to crashes and the SSD not liking forced reboots as a boot drive very much.No eggs taken off for these, because any problem I have had can and has been solved with ease (Even the chipset issues, which were due to my motherboard and not the drive anyway) and Samsung Magician is optional.

1715,Best Bang for the Buck! 5 second OS logon,"
Overall Review:
            I am getting around 4 to 5 second OS logon screen.  I would have gone with the 850 PRO but found this to be a better bargain for my budget.
        ","
Pros:
                Having been a user of HDD or mechanical drives for over 20 years, I almost started to cry after loading my OS on this machine.   My first SSD, which I did my homework on, did not let me down.  In my opinion, for the price, the 850 EVO reads and writes lightning fast and accomplishes all tasks that I throw at it!  I own a business consulting service and work with database programs.

1717,Great Upgrade,"
Overall Review:
            The drive made noise. I know… there are no moving parts but it made a screeching noise under load. I isolated the drive on its own power lead and changed SATA ports but the screeching persisted. Newegg was great and replaced the drive and now the new drive is nice and quiet. I’m guessing the first drive had a challenged capacitor.
        ","
Pros:
                I have an older x58 motherboard that only supports SATA II and doing after a lot of research, I decided to buy the SSD knowing I wouldn’t get the benefit of SATA III transfer speeds. Didn’t matter… the 850 Evo made a noticeable difference in the system’s performance.  The only time I wish I had SATA III is editing video which is bandwidth intensive so the drive is limited by SATA II. If you have an older motherboard, don’t hesitate and buy this drive. It’s a great upgrade.

            I just wish the Samsung Magician software would read my two SSD's in Raid, if you plan on Raiding this SSD, im going to save you the time and say the software cannot detect either drive in raid, it reads it as Intel Raid 0 Volume. Its not the SSD's fault so theres no reason to remove eggs for quality.and another thing, for you guys taking eggs off because the software disk wasn't included, if you actually went to Samsung's website and search ""Samsung Magician"" you can download it from there. Stop leaving negative reviews for stupid issues. you can fix it yourself.besides, your buying the DRIVE, not the SOFTWARE. Rate the hardware. Stop under-rating for the software, you don't even need it to be honest. It works just fine without it.

This is literally the biggest boost you'll get if your still running from a 7500 RPM HDD like I was. im sure just one of these will boost everything for you!I am going to buy 2 500GB Variants of this exact SSD and Raid 0 them together for my Steam games and Programs.I will NEVER go back to a HDD unless its for storage!

Overall Review:
            I originally put this in a caddy in my optical bay, I was sad cuz it was only like 50% of advertised speeds but still lightning fast. Then I noticed it was on sata 2, apparently almost all sata connections for optical bays is sata 2. So I swapped my old hdd into the caddy and put the ssd in the original hard drive spot and boom advertised speeds. Also the Samsung cloning software is awesome, it really takes a lot of the nerd work out so that even a non tech person could do this easily. The magican software is pretty nice too, it let's u easily optimize your settings for max performance or a few other things. Samsung does 90% of the work for you all you got to do is format the drive, use samsung cloning, and after the clone is finished select the new drive as priority boot drive in your bios. That was literally it. No swapping drive letters or anything, samsung took care of that too. It's so easy my mom could probably do it. Have I mentioned how fast it is yet?
        ","
Pros:
                This thing is super fast. I get almost exact advertised speeds with mine. My laptop used to take about 2 to 3 minuts before it was actually usable because of all the programs that auto launch and check for updates on windows startup. Now it's closer to 10 seconds.

Cons:

Cons:
                RMA'd the first one, after much time spent troubleshooting I found that it was frozen beyond proper recognition of any drive management software.I initially was worried that this drive was going to be very particular about setup - although after doing a bit of research (I had heard some negative things about getting this drive to work on certain AMG chipsets) and talking with Samsung, it wasn't all that bad dealing with the replacement that arrived later.

                And then I started running some benchmarks to compare to my 840 Pro boot drive. I planned on using this as a game drive for those games that take an ungodly long time to load; Civ V, Shogun 2: Total War, etc. So I wanted tot make sure that this drive was indeed much, much faster than the WD Blacks that I was already running in RAID 0.Well I ran the AS-SSD benchmark and the results were abysmal. I was getting sequential read/write speeds of 395MB/s and 280MB/s. Even worse was the 4K write speed which hovered around .90MB/s. Yes, that's a decimal point in front of that 9.I thought perhaps something was incorrectly set up in the UEFI - even though I have AHCI enabled and all of my SATA ports are 6Gb/s. So I booted into the UEFI and ran into yet another issue - my motherboard couldn't see it. I plugged it into another SATA port; again, couldn't see it. Tried it a third time and still ran into the same issue.Somehow my Windows 8.1 install saw it, but not my motherboard. So that, combined with the incredibly abysmal performance speeds and I had no option but to issue an RMA

Overall Review:
            I should have done my research. My motherboard only has SATA II ports, which are limited to a max throughput of 300MB/s. Also, it only has PCIe x1 v1.1 ports, so the SATA III add-on card I bought was actually limited to 200MB/s throughput. So I could have saved a few buck by going with a slower SSD that still would max out the capabilities of my SATA II controller. I'm building an i7 system soon, so I'll be able to take full advantage of it then.

Pros:
                First off a disclaimer: this is my first modern SSD. I've made a few embedded systems using what we used to call Disk on Modules, and the performance of them was alright, definitely better than a hard drive, but not blazing fast. The also were relatively small, most no bigger than a few gigs. By comparison, those things were a Yugo, this is a Ferrari. I'm still running a Core 2 Quad desktop, and I was afraid this wouldn't make much of a difference, but was I ever wrong. Windows 7 boots up in just a few seconds, game levels load faster, basically anything that involves loading or moving lots of data on the hard drive is much, much faster than it used to be.

            ","
Cons:
                I was a little disappointed when I didn't find a USB to SATA adapter included with the drive. The instructions imply that one is included, as the graphics in the manual display such a device, and a drive migration obviously cannot be completed without, but one is not included. There were no screws included either. This is probably not a big deal, because most people purchasing this device will be swapping out a HDD that already has the screws needed. Still, the inclusion of a few cheap spare screws should be a given when you are forking out $100+ on any drive. Again, overall, not a big deal, but a slight disappointment.

Overall Review:
            Fast even on my dated SATA 2 PC. Used Samsung included software to migrate. Only difficulty migrating were my mistakes the first try, second time went without a hitch. That was with OEM no disk Windows 7 32bit pro, I was worried about the OEM accepting the drive swap, but no problems.Also no issues using Magician. Which is weird, my computer accepting both Samsung programs, usually it gags at everything.RAPID rated twice as fast on quick Magician and other benchmarks,but didn't test too critically. Seems faster works fine when running programs. I maxxed out the RAM and am waiting on a new GPU (Zotac GTX750Ti, one of few that fits) -it's only a Dell OptiPlex 760 mini tower with a SATA 2 Mboard but the SSD, RAM(only pc-6400) and GPU should lighten the load a lot. Much less straining and lugging along so far.Very happy with how it's working, would recommend to friends for speeding up PCs.

1756,Smoking fast drive,"
Overall Review:
            If you're replacing a HDD with a SSD then you MUST set windows directly or via Magician that you have SSD and to change the appropriate settings.The difference in GB from 1024 based and 1000 based sizing - will say you've got roughly 900 ""gig"" . All drives do this now - and most of them (including Samsung) use that difference for sparing, wear leveling, reliability. This is most important in SSDs so I don't complain so much.Samsung Magician also request that you ""Over Provision"" by letting it ""use"" up to 10% of the last partition on your drive. This ""over provisioning"" is used for ""fast writes"" that it later coalesces into your partitions ""where it belongs"". This helps as a flash write requires a read-insert-write cycle unless it's known a flash block is empty. So ""over provisioning"" uses free space (known empty) as skip-read-do-write blocks so is much faster. That said - I'm told 8.1 may do this already - and I haven't found anything concise. Then you can use that space on that last partition - so it's not lost . Folks mostly say don't let any partition get more than 75% full and there should be enough ""free space"" for these SSD write optimizations to work..Samsung Magician's performance benchmark is inconsistent. After a few days it started saying my sequential was 1/10th of what it should be. Per the web :) I used ATTO benchmark and it showed the drive was running as recommended.Many people say you must ""start from scratch"" on a HDD->SSD but that's not true. You just need to make the system changes.Samsung Data Migration will purport to make all these - but it wouldn't let me migrate from an (mostly empty) 2TB hdd in a new laptop to the 1GB 850 EVO. Few tools will shrink partitions (not even Acronis) So you can do well just copying partitions over hdd->SSD but you need to tweak the settings. Magicians ""optimize OS"" will do that for you. Or from disk properties, advanced, Optimize : make sure all your partitions are set to optomize, and I'd say once per day.Enjoy these smoking fast drives!
        ","

                This drive is smoking fast and generally meets or exceeds Samsung's published specs.
            ","
Cons:
                Samsung Magician is inconsistent and poor about settings and properly reporting performance. Generally requires reboot to change it's view of the world (esp partitions) even if it doesn't say so.

Overall Review:
            Happy camper.  One thought, though. After implementing Rapid Mode (a good idea from my point of view), I was left with not enough memory on my 8 GB, 6-yr-old machine for certain memory-hungry applications. I immediately ordered a 16 GB kit to replace what I had, and my desktop now operates like a brand new machine.
        ","
Pros:
                Worked perfectly on a SATA-2 machine, even though it was a SATA-3 SSD.  Even still, the difference in speed was immediately evident. Samsung's Magician software helped with optimization, and along with some add'l manual adjustments, performance was increased considerably (changing SATA mode to AHCI made the biggest difference). Installing this on a SATA-3 machine would probably be dramatic.

Cons:
                The Samsung software that accompanied it for cloning my C-Drive would not work. My C-Drive HDD was a dynamic drive and the cloning software could not handle that.

I installed mine in an older Sony Vaio laptop running only SATA2.  I connected the SSD with an adaptor through USB and cloned the old drive.  After cloning (which took all night) the new Samsung worked flawlessly.  The boot time reduced from over 3 mins to 1 min (probably would be better if the computer had SATA3), and the laptop feels way more snappy.This is my 3rd Samsung SSD and 4th SSD total, and all work without problems.

Overall Review:
            I ordered this product ( 2 in fact) while it was on sale and had it shipped Super Saver 4-7 business days.  On day 8 I was still waiting on the product and chatted with a Newegg customer service rep.  I told him that the status from the shipper had not changed in 8 days and I was wondering if the product was really coming.   He urged me to open a claim and I did, but I was really only seeking shipping status.The next day I checked the shipping number on the shippers website, and instead of seeing a ship date I saw a notice that shipping status was no longer available.Concerned I called the shipping company and they told me that the they had rec'd a shipping notification, but had never received a package, and that the item had never shipped and the shipping number was closed. Now I am really concerned.  I called Newegg and talked to a rep.  He could not tell me when the item would be shipped to me because it was now in the claim process.  I told him that I was out $356, didn't have a product, and whatever internal supply chain issues that Newegg and their shipping company were having should not involve me.  I pressed him to simply ship me the product and correct their internal fulfillment issues without involvign me.  Although the rep was polite and quite courteous, it was clear to me that he did not have the authority to address my concerns. I asked to speak to the rep' s manager and within a few second I had him on the phone.  I went over the details one more time, and the manager offered me 3 alternatives.  I accepted the 3rd option which was repurchase the product at the sale price, have it shipped overnight to me at no charge, and receive a refund when the claim process is completed.   I have a been a long term customer of Newegg and they had never let me down before so I took a chance and accepted the option even though I had doubts about locking up another $356. I am happy to report that the 2 SSD drives arrived this morning, and this afternoon the claim was processed and I was refunded my first purchase price.Newegg took a bad situation and turned it into a very positive experience for me.  Count me as one satisfied customer!  Newegg has earned brand loyalty from me.They clearly dropped the ball, but to their credit they went the distance even when it cost them a little extra to keep a customer happy.  What more can a customer ask for?I'll continue to send business their way.  They proved to me that they can be trusted to be a great place to shop online.  When things go badly as they sometimes do, Newegg makes it right! Thanks again Newegg for a great shopping experience!Tony

1794,Disappointing shipping,"
Overall Review:
            The reason for this review is mainly for this ""Other thoughts"" section, and unfortunately, it's directed at Newegg.I ordered parts for a brand new build all at once, expecting them to come from different places as Newegg has distribution centers across the US.Indeed, the tower case and a few other items started from the east coast, while these SSDs came from the west coast. Also from the west coast was some platter HDDs, CPU, and RAM.However, the SSDs came in a separate shipment from the HDDs, CPU and RAM. Rather than ship them all in one box, they came in two. I do not have an issue with this, nor would I have had an issue if they had arrived over the course of a few days. What does upset me is that they were delivered on the same day, on the same truck, but in two wildly different packages and packaging quality.The HDDs, CPU, and RAM came in a well handled box with plenty of air packaging to reduce bumps during shipping. The SSDs, however, were in a box absolutely mangled, looking as if the box had fallen out once every 100 miles from CA to UT. What's worse is that all of the air packing had been deflated, so it was just a bunch of plastic surrounding the boxes containing the drives.To me, it seems as if Newegg warehousing was just abusing the no-moving-part-ness of SSDs and thew them in with air wrap that has deflated over time in order to re-use plastic and cut costs.Even more so, I would be (mostly) fine with all of this but the fact that I had two boxes come in different states, the one containing properly inflated wrapping and good care, having plenty of space to fit two SSDs, and the other with poor packing, just shows some deliberate packing choices on Newegg's part.The SSDs have passed all stress tests I've thrown at them, and I still intend to run them in RAID 0, but it was disappointing to have a distributor such as Newegg, one that I love and trust, treat a package so poorly.

I hooked it up via a regular SATA cable and I thought since I had an 840 EVO 500gb, upgrading to the 1tb 850 EVO would be no problem using samsungs software. Huge problem, and is currently not resolved. The software could not differentiate between the 2 drives and could not successfully migrate the data. I spent about 3 hours on this before giving up.

            I see a lot of negative ratings and comments due to lack of brackets and cables.  Every hard drive have ever bought did not come with any hardware or cables.  Maybe some retail packaged drives do, but I don't see the reason behind giving bad ratings for this.  It is a 2.5"" drive, so if you use it in a desktop you WILL need a bracket.  Also, most of us already have a SATA cable.  If not, you can buy them ridiculously cheap here on newegg.com.  The price for this drive given its reliability and speed is very good, so buying a cable and bracket to me seems like a non-issue.

Overall Review:
            I see some complaints about the software that comes with it, i didn't use the data migration software as i already use Acronis True Image to keep my system backed up.  I just connected this 850 EVO in place of my failing drive and used the Acronis Bootable Recovery that i have on a flash drive to boot up and recover from the last good image a couple days prior as my most recent backup was corrupted due to the failing drive, no biggie its just the OS drive no personal data.After i was booted up i did install the Samsung Magician software just to check optimization and settings as well as to check it had the latest firmware (which it did ship with the latest version) and ran some performance tests, pretty much right on the money with its specs.I upgraded from another SSD that was starting to have some issues which i discovered after Acronis started complaining that there was unreadable sectors during a backup.  Obviously the source of my random crashes and problems i have been having for a few days prior to that notice.This 850 EVO is FAST, it made a noticeable difference even upgrading from a previous generation of SSD's.  Highly recommend it!

1822,Samsung 850 evo 500GB Sata III,"
Overall Review:
            If you installed Windows 7 in IDE mode and realize you actually needed AHCI mode for better SSD performance, you can fix this issue easily.  You can't just go into the Bios during windows 7 boot up or your OS will crash.  The following are instructions on how I corrected my IDE to AHCI:1) Startup -> Regedit2) Open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SYSTEM / CurrentControlset / Services3) Open msahci4) In the right pane, left click on ""start"" then right click and select ""Modify""5) In the ""value"" data field enter ""0"" and click OK.6) exit Regedit7) Reboot your system and enter your BIOS (hold ""Delete"" key while rebooting)8) In the BIOS select ""Integrated Peripherals"" and Onchip PATA/SATA Devices.9) Change SATA Mode to AHCI from IDE10) Save and exit BIOS, and boot into Windows 7.  The OS will recognize AHCI and install the devices.  Your system will now need one more reboot, then you'll have the screaming SSD you've always wanted.
        ","
Pros:
                My OCZ 64Gb drives was down to the last 420mb.  They were great drives, but a 5 year old Sata II SSDs don't compare to this Sata III  beast.  I bought 2, one for my PC and one for my wife's PC.  I will definitely be buying one more of these for my daughter's PC.This Samsung SSD comes with Data Migration software for cloning an existing partition as well as Samsung Magician software for optimizing the drive.  There is no need to buy or download any other cloning software.  The cloning process was easy and took about an hour with an external USB to Sata II enclosure (I had one laying around).The Samsung Magician software identified that I had the SSD set for IDE and not AHCI (AHCI is much faster).Benchmarks with the SSD set for IDE were terrible, and here they are:Benchmarks are as follows:Sequential Read - 346 MB/SecSequential Write - 440 MB/SecRandom Read - 9074 IOPSRandom Write - 18,623 IOPSAfter correcting and converting to AHCI my benchmarks are as follows:Sequential Read - 532 MB/SecSequential Write - 506 MB/SecRandom Read - 39,839 IOPSRandom Write - 34,084 IOPSMuch improved and you can really tell the difference, especially with game loading.

Cons:
                The ""Data Migration"" software that it ships with is fast (80MB/s from my HDD - looks like it does a sequential read from the original drive), it doesn't miss anything, and it can shrink a larger volume to fit on the SSD(in my case a 485GB volume was shunk to ~238GB to fit on this SSD), but it requires you to reactivate windows once completed. I didn't want to deal with that nonsense so I repeated the process using the free version of Macrium Reflect.

            This is my second SSD from Samsung. The other one was the 830 series and after 3 years of use it is still going strong. Never had any data loss or stability problems with that one. Hopefully this one lasts a long time as well.
        ","
Pros:
                Bought it on sale to replace my stock HDD on the laptop. After the installation, the overall performance and battery life of the laptop increased quite a bit, as expected. Complete installation of Windows 8.1 from scratch took about 10 minutes compared to 40+ minutes with the stock 5400 RPM HDD. Instant turn on from sleep and less than 10 seconds of boot time from complete shut down. Very happy with it so far.

This will be the 3rd evo drive I own and each is purring away as we speak my work station stays on 24/7 365 days a year.  I give it 4 eggs due to it's ""deal"" but they love to take something when its a deal so...

Cons:
                I give it. I paid very little for this one sale i think it was like 185 with free shipping so cant beat it, but it was one of those return only in 30 days things. At the same time I wish it has a better warranty. Other than none.

1883,Superspeed...!,"
Overall Review:
            Windows will recognize the drive if your bios/UEFI is set to either AHCI or IDE (just not RAID, remember.)  Of course, we don't want to use anything except AHCI.  You can still get RAID arrays while your motherboard is set AHCI, of course--just use Windows Disk Management to create the arrays by *striping two physical disks* into the number of RAID 0 partitions you want.  I use twin 500GB Seagate 'Cudas formatted into two RAID 0 partitions--drives E:\ and F:\ in my system.  It's commonly called ""software RAID"" but it runs 99% as fast as so-called ""hardware RAID"" as far as I can see.  I think (but don't know) that Samsung has done something to make these drives invisible to Windows under a RAID controller because sometimes the TRIMM commands are not passed through the RAID drivers even though they are supposed to be ""AHCI-compatible.""  Windows configures hardware RAID as scsi devices, so that might be the ""problem.""  It's all really moot, however, because just one of these SSD's in AHCI mode boots Window far faster than any RAID 0 mechanical-drive configuration I have ever seen!  Love it.
        ","
Pros:
                Fantastic product--faster than I thought it would be--a quality SSD like this 250GB Samsung 850 SSD is the closest thing in performance to a ram disk you can buy.  Great buy as an OS boot disk!--Win10x64 boots in 8 seconds--and I mean a full boot--not just to the desktop screen...;)  This drive comes with a 5-year warranty--longer than anyone else's, AFAIK, except another Samsung SSD which has a 10-year warranty...!
            ","
Cons:
                Windows 7/8.1/10 will not recognize the 850 as a bios/UEFI RAID device, so beware of that!  It's weird--when set to UEFI RAID my 970 Gaming motherboard properly detects the device at boot and it is visible in the EFI--but Windows absolutely will not see the drive after that, even though I'm using AHCI-compatible RAID drivers that see all of my other non-RAID array drives/partitions  without a problem.  However, there is a solution--which is why I gave it 5 stars, anyway!

Checked the BIOS, and its not listed. I'm using a new Clevo W740SU laptop to install from scratch. I call tech support, they say to disable all HD sleep setting in the power options. You can use Samsung software to do this (It actually creates a power setting called Samsung Power Save and I think disables all HD sleeping while the laptop is on.

1911,Works pretty good for Crosshair Nvidia motherboard,,"
Pros:
                I have a 2009 Media Computer I built with the original ROG Crosshair motherboard that has the Nvidia chipset and drivers included. Even though the Magician software doesn't like the Nvidia chipset or drivers, there wasn't much I could do about changing the controller driver, it's set in stone no matter what I tried. The BIOS doesn't have any settings for SSD's either, but it did read the SSD correctly.  Anyway, I went on ahead and used Acronis cloning software to clone my aging 7 year old HDD to the SSD. After switching over and rebooting, Windows 7 64bit was up and running in half the time! It is still much quicker than my old SATA II HDD. This SSD will run in SATA II as I found out on my old 2007 Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop, it's not 6Gbs, but still much faster than the mechanical HDD.  I made the settings that I could make in the Magician software for maximum longevity and provisioning, so at the very least I got that! I couldn't make any other settings with it. The SSD is running pretty good so far and very happy with it. I hope this helps others out there that are uncertain about upgrading their aging computers like me. :-)

            Awesome Drive when you can get it at the right price.

I know this is a hardware review but since the product contained the SW and cost me several hours of frustration it's fair game. I got error after error attempt after attempt with that software. I didn't feel like using the open source solutions (GParted and Clonezilla) so I was lucky the old drive being replaced was a Western Digital. If you have a WD drive you can download and use the Acronis True Image WD Edition Software even if you are cloning from a WD HDD to a NonWD drive. Do it!  Worked like a charm by quickly re-sizing my larger HDD to fit on the smaller SSD -- which is typical scenario these days when replacing an HDD with an SSD.

Whether these SSDs are configured in a RAID array or not, you're going to have trouble.  Samsung blames the chipsets/controller.  Funny because EVERY other brand SSD works just fine in this environment.  So far, Newegg is refusing to do anything other than an exchange for identical drives.  Of course, since it is an issue with ALL 850 EVO drives, this will do me no good whatsoever.  Looks like I'll just be out $400+

I accidently used the ones that came with my motherboard and found out they were 3GB/s which hindered the performance.  So be sure to use 6GB/s SATA cables. If your unsure if you have 6GB/s cables then look at the cable and the markings if your still unsure just buy new ones.  It will be worth the small investment.

Pros:
                Well,  it is quiet, starts right up, runs cool and is faster than my old hard drive and my external USB 3.0 SSD and SATA and Thumb drives.  That being said,  It is operating at far less than its capacity.  My computer card is not SATA III,  but rather SATA.  The Real bugaboo is that AFTER I get this drive and AFTER I install it,  AND AFTER I load the copy and data from my old SATA drive it tells me that the AHCI is not enabled and I need to enable it to get the best performance out of my new ssd drive.  So I go to the bios and guess what?  It is not an option to ""enable"" the AHCI mode.  After several hours of researching I find that it will NEVER be possible on my computer to run either the RAID mode or the AHCI mode so I am just stuck with having a drive that has all the benefits that I mentioned,  but will never live up to its potential in my desk top owing to the BIOS limitations of my motherboard etc.  OH WELL.  My only complaint would be ... This information should be on the box! OR they should have an online program that evaluates the system of your machine and then tells you what ssd you should purchase.  I believe Crucial does this.  But Samsung at least did not do it with this drive and on Newegg.  That is why I gave it a 3 rather than higher.

Overall Review:
            This isn't a con, but the only way I could get this drive working in Windows 8.1 Pro 64x was to split it into 2 partitions.  The EVGA Z97 Stinger motherboard bios detected it, Windows detected it, but I couldn't format it until I broke it into 2 500~GB partitions.   I thought I missed a step or perhaps I did something wrong with the initial setup, but I also purchased the 500GB drive same model and it installed with no issues at all.  Just an 'other thought'.

                This is a fantastic drive.  The EVGA Z97 Stinger mb detected it on post and Win 8.1 Pro 64x installed on it quickly.  This is one seriously fast drive.  I installed 50 games on it as well as a host of apps, Windows boots in about 8 seconds.

                I got this SSD because it was a really good price for the storage and write speeds, and also because Samsung is a good brand. It does come with software for if you want to migrate/clone your current HDD over to it, so that's a plus.

Overall Review:
            In my experience, the Samsung cloning software is a joke.  I see from other reviews that it worked perfectly for some and not at all for others.  In my case, with a fully patched Win7 system, it runs for half an hour or so and then reveals that if there are ""some problem"" the cloning may fail.  When acknowledged, there is a several second pause followed by ""Cloning Failed 400180[061b34]  Naturally, neither Samsung nor the cloning tool's author (apparently Clonix Co. Ltd) provide any clue as to what may be wrong.  I ran the Win7 disk check with all correction enabled, it completed without incident but a second attempt to clone also failed.  I've set it aside and if I have a spare day will try to install it in a Linux box where I will have no illusions that any of the Samsung software will work..

Once the cloning software has been forced to install, it does not, in my experience, work. See below.The ""documentation"" for the software is one step beyond hieroglyphs with essentially no text.

            Not really too important, but this hovers at 35.0c for me, which is ~7.0c warmer than my Intel 530 and ~5.0c warmer than my Silicon Power S60.I am not interested in the RAPID mode as your data will be lost if a power outage happens due to it being stored in RAM at the time. The speeds from it are great in benchmarks, but there is very little difference actually noticed in typical computing.As I stated before, it does not come with a SATA cable, but they're cheap so it's not a big deal.

Pros:
                Bought this when it was on sale for $170. One of the best purchases made for my build. Absolutely incredible read speeds.

Pushing the power button until Windows boots to desktop takes about 10-15 seconds.

Cons:
                Does not come with SATA cable. As others have mentioned, the software isn't that great, but that's not worth docking any eggs since that's not the SSD fault. All I used it for was mirroring the old SSD. Nothing wrong with the SSD itself, though.

Cons:
                Software!The software provided for cloning your original disk image is by no means reliable. looking through the event logs after cloning many errors relating to file locations appear. Restore points will no longer be created automatically because the software doesn't remove the old drive from its listings. those are a few examples for problems you will face.The biggest and hardest to diagnose is one that I faced and that was on initial boot up sometimes the bio's wouldn't find the boot manager and would fail to boot. After a reset/reboot it would work perfectly fine. If this issue occurs its with 95% likely hood that its the image clone and NOT a defective drive. Re-image the drive with another cloning tool and see if it fixes the issue or try a fresh install if possible.

            Samsung is definitely a name you can trust. Their hardware and products across all mediums are solid and trustful. I purchased this drive to replace the one that came with a PC I bought at the same time as the main drive. The lack of mounting screws was disappointing, as the screws that typically fit any drive did not want to fit this one at all. I had to go through a bin of random screws to find some that would actually fit this drive and hold it in place. There is no cables included with this drive so be sure to buy an extra SATA cable if you need one! Also a power adapter if you need one as well.This drive came with an instruction book on how to copy existing files over to this drive using a USB adapter that is not even included. Seems kind of odd to include anything like that when the parts needed are not included with the package.Overall a great buy, great and solid drive and performs well.

            Love these drives. Upgraded from an 840 Evo. Not really any reason to be honest, however I decided that I was going to give my sons computer a boost by upgrading his slow HHD to a speedy SSD. It made sense to give him my year old 840Evo and upgrade to the 850Evo in my rig.The 850 Evo is slightly faster overall, but it is considerably faster with the random read and writes. It does not suffer from the slow down issues that the 840Evo has (although I have not noticed any issues with the 840Evo).All in all a great drive. I really like the Samsung SSD's.I have nothing bad to say about these drives.Buy one today, no real reason to hold back if you have a slow HHD. Capacities are increasing and prices are dropping.

Pros:
                I was having problems with BIOS sometimes not detecting the 850 EVO drive during boot up.    Problem was that I had the drive plugged into my secondary SATA3.0 6Bb/s  Marvell 88SE9128 controller.  It runs of the South Bridge and not directly off the Intel chipset.   The slight delay in initializing the Marvell controller during boot causes bios to not see the SDD in time to boot off of it.  Doesn't always happen but often enough.Set your BIOS configuration to AHCI and not IDE or you'll have problems in the long run with drive efficiency degrading.

                The installation 'guide' was pretty useless. It's basically a bunch of pictures. It also covers installation into a desktop system using some kind of USB adapter. I would have been pretty angry if that was required, but migrating data using SATA cabling worked just fine. The migration software itself was designed by brain dead programmers. I had about 520GB of data on my system drive, which I was planning to only partially migrate. The migration software had an option to select files to migrate but warned me that any files I did not migrated would be deleted and that I should back them up first. That is completely unacceptable. Any competent software guy could write software that copied the desired files and left the rest alone.Secondly, the method to pick files to migrate or not migrate was designed just as badly. I was allowed to only select files with certain extensions and no way to pick an entire directory or set of directories.So I ended up spending about 5 hours repartitioning my system drive and backing up some 3-400GB of data I didn't need on my SSD.So overall rating, 5 for the drive itself and the driver software. Zero for the migration software.

Overall Review:
            I have been building computers for years but had never really thought about getting an SSD until I bought an ultrabook that had one, the difference truly is night and day when it comes to bootup and simple opening of programs installed onto it. I can't wait for the day when these become affordable enough to warrant getting one for mass storage. I still recommend a 120/250gb SSD for the boot and an HDD for mass storage though.

1981,Samsung 850 EVO 500GB and Samsung  Magician,"
Overall Review:
            This is my first SSD and I tried to migrate from my 1TB Seagate C/OS HHD. I'm running a desktop PC with an Intel iCore 7, 8Gb RAM, SATA 3 and with AHCI enabled as well as TRIM. Performance of the SSD is OK but the Samsung Magician Migration software was a bust. Tried it twice with no positive results; I was disappointed. I then tried AOMEI Backupper and ended up with an unhappy C/OS SSD, it just did not seem to run properly. I finally tried a restored from an existing, current, Acronis True Image C/OS drive backup. All went well and upon installing the drive into the PC it was as if the existing Seagate HDD had never left. It now runs stable and it is just faster. Since that Acronis restore and installing the SSD into my desktop PC I have waited 10-14 days to write this and I have noticed no issues. I believe that in using the restore file it helps to negate any fragmentation of files that may occur using migration as well as any issues in going from a 1TB HHD to a 500Gb SSD; I may be wrong but this seems to make sense to me.So if you are having any issues similar to mine try Acronis, I was shocked that it could be so far superior to Samsung Magician and AOEMI Backupper for what I wanted to do. Acronis did what it was supposed to and that ain't bad.I do not believe, other than boot, that desktops users see the profound speed improvements that laptop users experience. Most desktops run 7200 RPM HHDs whereas laptops run 5400 RPM HDDs, so there is an inherent slower speed from laptop HDDs. Therefore a desktop users initial HHD speeds are far superior to laptops HDD speed so the sense of speed improvement will be far more noticeable for a laptop user. Do app/programs and such load faster on the desktop PC, yes, but not enormously so. Also, rendering videos and Photoshop images etc. will always show better performance using an SSD.

Overall Review:
            I have been using the 840 PRO 256GB in two computers for over a year with no issues at all with an ASUS P5Q Pro motherboard with either 8 or 16 GB RAM, a processor running at 4 GHZ. and a generic SATA III add-on card as the boot/system SSD drive controller and large RAID arrays as the user drives using the SATA II motherboard ports. As the SSD drive was getting pretty full, I thought it was time to upgrade to 500GB.  I have tried three different 850 EVO 500GB drives and all experience file corruption within days of use hooked to the same add-on port that the 840 PRO works happily on.  Samsung service states they will only support a drive with direct motherboard connections.  In my case that would mean reverting to the slower SATA II ports on the motherboard - as if any were available with the RAID.  So, buyer beware.

            I purchased this with the intent of cloning my hard drive to this new Samsung SSD.  I didn't use their cloning software, so I can't comment on the quality of it.  I used the Acronis brand since I already has a copy of it.  No issues at all replacing the drive, I'm really pleased the decreased scan times for searches and antivirus, as well as the very noticeable decrease in reboot time (Win 7).  I haven't done any actual benchmarks, but it's easy to tell that my PC is more responsive.

Overall Review:
            I've owned several different SSD's from several different manufacturers, and so far Samsung takes the cake in all categories. Every manufacturer is going to ship out a dud once in a while, but your chances are minimized when getting the Samsung EVO series.
        ","
Pros:
                I picked this drive up for $99 shipped a couple weeks ago. Compare that to the 840 EVO 250GB that I bought a year ago at $180 and thought that was a deal... oh well. I'm glad storage prices are on the down again.Samsung SSD's are top of the line. Reliability and performance are hard to beat, especially for the price. I'm now running this SSD in RAID-0 (block level striped performance) in combination with the afore mentioned 840 EVO, both attached to SATA3 ports. During setup of this configuration I learned to watch out for mixing SATA2 and SATA3 ports on a RAID configuration, or you might experience corrupted files or volumes with extreme difficulty troubleshooting the problem... I almost sent the SSD back for RMA!Most reviewers are going to provide you with some single-drive performance numbers, so I won't beat a dead horse. Instead, here are my RAID-0 performance numbers for your enjoyment:[ATTO v2.47  - 256MB length - Direct I/O - Neither mode]File Size, Read speed, Write speed---------------------------------------1KB, 19MB/s, 24MB/s4KB, 59MB/s, 61MB/s64KB, 347MB/s, 406MB/s1MB, 884MB/s, 909MB/s8MB, 1015MB/s, 1045MB/sFor the first time ever, I was able to break the 1GB/s barrier!The Samsung Magician software shows similar performance results, as well as HD Tune v2.55. I'm very, VERY, pleased with these SSD's!
            ","
Cons:
                I have no cons about the drive itself. It's a perfect 10 as far as I'm concerned.However, I wish the drive came with a 3.5"" to 2.5"" bracket, because I'm running out and keep having to order more.I also wish it came with a SATA cable... running out of those, too!

                Still a bit pricey. Unclear if this series will suffer same problem as all of the 840 series of massive decrease in read speed for data not used recently. With no apparent move to replace the affected devices. Attempts by Samsung at fixing the problem have failed. Only offer so far has been to RMA the device and they will send you a ""REFURBISHED"" replacement. No way.Instructions still not good. I tried the data migration from the CD again. First one of these I bought  it would not work at all. This one worked, but it generated a message before starting warning that any open files will not be copied. If this is true - this is not a way to migrate you existing disk. Have they not heard of shadow copy or the various techniques use by pretty much all of the backup products that will clone a drive? Clone a new drive without any of the open files. Duh.

I bought this because I thought the HDD was failing, due to laggy (3min to 20 min) boot times and the seemingly daily Windows 7 security patches.  Was forced by windows to do defrag and partition shrink to fit a 40GB used 500GB partition to a 232GB SDD.  Took 2 days to get windows' log, virus vault, appdata, and fragmented excluded files off of the 60% mark and last 3% of the partition.  Thanks PerfectDisk (free) and AOEIM partition cloning software, cuz the Win 7 admin tools configuration manager disk drive management and defrag tool just couldn't cut it.  For a laptop buy the Samsung sata to usb connector.  It'll save you 2 days of disassembly/reassembly and having to use another PC's extra slots.Funny thing:  after defragging 4 times, and shrinking the drive to 130GB =>  The laptop boot time went from 3-5 min down to 1 min.

2046,Nothing but Happy,"
Overall Review:
            Some reviews have said windows 7 clean install will not recognize the drive. It will... you have to select ""New"" on the install window when you are selecting the drive for windows to install on so it will format the drive as needed.  Ive tested a few of the drives for speed. depending on your processor they perform near or at the speed advertised when using the rapid boost option in the Samsung software.  FYI you don't need to use the Samsung software in win 7 or higher, however you can install the software, then optimize the drive then uninstall the software and it will remain as optimized excluding the rapid boost.  I run a PRO pair in raid 0 and have a third EVO as a ghost backup drive I connect with a USB adapter. Tip for the migration... Be sure to disable your antivirus and make sure your windows updates are current prior to doing the migration. Quarantined sections of the disk can run into problems migrating and windows updates can mess with the OS if it is trying to migrate system files while they are set up for an update that is going in on the next shutdown.
        ","
Pros:
                Ive used and installed 6 Samsung  850 EVO SSD on mine and friends desktops and laptops.  Not a single hitch.  Fast as advertised when installed with a good MB and fast CPU.The free disk migration software is a big plus.The SSD cartridge is light alloy and sharp looking.
            ","
Cons:
                The boost mode can cause some games to glitch and crash. I turned boost off and have not had a problem since. the speed difference is slightly measurable in benchmarks, however not noticeable in games or desktop functions.

It can currently be found on the ""Downloads"" tab of the SSD support page on the Samsung website.Data Migration without using Samsung's bundled utility was accomplished easily using the disk clone feature in the free version of EaseUS Todo Backup. Some ""Samsung Magician"" functionality can also be easily accomplished using freely available applications (e.g. Performance Benchmark, Secure Erase) while other functionality appears to be completely unavailable (e.g. RAPID Mode, Over-Provisioning, Firmware Update).

Overall Review:
            I received this SSD after purchasing a new gaming laptop. I wanted to boot games as fast as possible. My laptop has two drive bays so I installed it first. I used the migration tool on the disc provided by Samsung. After a successful migration I would boot from the SSD. It was very glitchy, slow load times, programs crash or don't work at all. I formatted and attempted a migration a number of times with the same tool and easUS tool. Problems still persist. I spoke with Samsung about the issue and they told me to do a secure format and provided me with an iso to make a bootable disc to do so. After that the problems still existed. I spoke to Samsung again, and was told that a migration of an OS will NEVER be perfect and that i needed to do a clean install of the OS. Computers don't come with discs anymore so I found a tool developed by Microsoft to create an installation ""disc"" from a flash drive. Finally after all the trouble, a clean install has worked. After doing all this I've come to the conclusion that shavings mere seconds off your boot and load times aren't justified after all the tedious work. Not to mention Samsung provides a tool and then claims that it doesn't work as well as a fresh install. I would've been more satisfied knowing at the time of purchase that I'd need a fresh OS installation. In the end I don't think its worth it. However, it does work, and does it very well. The experience was just annoying.

AMD invented the technology these Samsung SSDs are based on; you'd think they would have an interest in making their drivers recognize them.

I have this SSD strictly for my OS and critical programs I launch on windows startup. Not exaggerating at all, once it gets passed the starting windows screen, it takes 3 seconds to go from that screen, to opening my internet browser. And you know when sometimes your computer says needs to restart to finish installing updates? and you dreaded it all along because it was an inconvenience? Its no longer an inconvenience. At night when I shut my computer down, when I click shut down, I immediately get out of my chair and leave the room. (about 10 feet) By the time I get to the door, the computer is already off. Its mind blowing. For the price, (which is incredible by the way) I 100% highly recommend this SSD over any HDD. Very affordable and will change your computer using experience.

Overall Review:
            With laptops running 5400rpm HDs this upgrade will be immediately apparent to the user. Your limiting spec is your hard drive when launching programs, this SSD makes sure you are not waiting on it.
        ","
Pros:
                So I bought this SSD to go with my newer mid level gaming laptop. Ran a few small tests prior with my old 1TB 5400rpm w/ 8gb sd: I had a 22 second startup with another 10 seconds to be able to fully launch a web browser immediately after start up. Also ran a HD benchmark and got an overall score of 667, that's a low tier HD. With the 850 Evo: Startup of 7 sec with immediate browser launch, benchmark score 4567. Everything loads very fast. Multitasking has not been the same since I got this and now I'm spoiled.
            ","
Cons:
                I don't know how I feel about the Samsung software yet. I like that it tracks my use which can give me a better idea on the life of the drive but the other features seem unnecessary (optimization, benchmarks ect).  Would prefer if it ran in the background without launching the user interface because I usually dislike a bunch of hardware programs running on my icon bar.

Cons:
                The only thing I can think is that in my case (and most other cases from what I've heard) it was necessary to install it 'backwards,' that is, with the SATA and power cables facing the back of my case. It's more of an aesthetic thing than anything else. I suppose I could just drill new holes... Not enough to take an egg off

Pros:
                I had an existing 512GB SSD which I needed to upgrade due to capacity limitations. My preferred brand is OCZ, but as they don't make a 1TB SATA drive, and Samsung is quite the the leader in SSD manufacturing, and the price per GB was nice, I decided to go with this drive. I chose the Evo over the Pro as multiple review sites have stated that non professional users will not benefit from the extra features and durability of Pro drives.
            ","
Cons:
                After using cloning software, not the included software, to prepare it and enabling RAPID, I ran Samsung's benchmark in Samsung Magician to compare its performance to my OCZ Vector and Vertex 460 which I use for my games and temp files/page file, respectively. Sequential read and write speed is at 938/2566MB/s, respectively, as a result of RAPID, but the 64280 IOPS read and 35926 IOPS write speed is well below Samsung's specification. It is using the latest firmware, EMT01B6Q.

            I was a little apprehensive about installing in my laptop, as I had never installed an SSD drive and read a lot of horror stories, but I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly the install went.  I was a little concerned that my SQL Server and associated databases would not migrate properly, but after firing up the machine with the SSD installed everything is working as it did before, only quicker.Boot time to login screen went from about 40 seconds down to about 10 seconds and the machine is fully up within a minute.  I'm logging into a domain, so it does take a bit longer than a non-domain machine, but even the login happened faster.The D630 is an older machine with a 4GB max RAM capacity, which had me thinking of getting a new laptop, but for a buck and a quarter it acts like a different machine and now performs close to as well as a new machine with a SATA drive.  Needless to say, I'm putting off the new laptop purchase for a while.At this early point I'm pretty happy with it.

2092,Samsung SSD,"
Overall Review:
            If you buy this drive make sure you remember to purchase the Sata cables also.  Make sure you use the new versions of the software from Samsung's site.  If you using this in a desktop computer you DO NOT need the USB to SATA adapter as it is PICTURED in the directions and like people have  blogged all over the internet.The recommended SATA III cable is a 6.0Gb/s.  That cable is backwards compatible for SATA II and SATA.  Check your mother board specifications to know which type of SATA port you have and purchase the cable that is for that port because not all motherboards are created equal or just get the SATA III and cover all your bases.  Even in the 3.0G/s port w/ the respective 3.0G/s cable, this drive benchmarked at the manufacturers specifications as strange as that sounds.  Looking online you will be told what other people think rather then what is truly recommended by the manufacturer.  Which, by the way, is not marked on their product anywhere or on Samsung's site. ALSO, make sure to use the software supplied by the manufacture called Samsung Magician (From their site not their included CD).  Contrary to what people blog and  think, it does increase the longevity of your drive by creating an extra partition and also gives you the RAPID mode feature that is unbelievably effective.  Also, the software helps you set the drive for optimization and over provisioning.  Important little tools that make this drive easier to use and maintain. I hope this helps and the drive, like I said, performs better then the manufacturer's specifications in my case but just like CPU's and GPU's they do not all perform the same but they do at least perform to the minimum specifications provided by the manufacturer.I am very happy with this purchase other then the CD software issues and the CABLE not being included.

                Speed and size.  This drive benchmarks over the specifications that it was sold under.  It is fast, if not faster then  I expected.

Hopefully with my explanation you can avoid the hours I spent trying to install this drive.

Cons:
                This drive did not come with anything other then the drive it's self.  So I had to order the Sata III cables after it arrived.  The software on the CD that came with the drive did not work and kept stopping during installation and giving me error codes.  It also said it could not find the drive and many other strange error codes came up.  I had to download the newer versions of the software from Samsung's site and then it installed correctly.  The funny part was when I went to Clone my original mechanical drive the software said the source disk was the SSD and the destination disk was the SSD and gave me no other options to change this.  I let it run anyway and it actually copied my original HDD to the SSD without an issue.

            I upgraded from a Mushkin 240GB SSD to this behemoth because I literally ran out of room. I know I could've bought another 240 or any other size in that matter to add to my PC, but I wanted to do a reformat anyways. I got this on sale when it was $379! The speed of this compared to my old SSD is still quite a big difference, and that shocks me because I thought my 240 was fast. Everything starts up within seconds (using Windows 7) and load times for my games are non-existent. I bought this because my Origin and Steam has so many games, but I could only have a couple installed at a time. I would have to finish a game and then uninstall it to reinstall another game. I'm not looking to install all 200+ games I have accrued over the years, but I would like more than just WoW, BF4, Borderland: Pre Sequel, and Dragon Age: Inquisition installed. Many friends play other games as well, but I have to constantly uninstall 1 to install a different game every other week. This 1TB drive has been amazing and I have had ZERO issues with this.

Overall Review:
            Advice from experience:Buy this SSD, in any capacity. You simply cannot get more bang for your buck in performance with either the EVO or the PRO. Light-years ahead of the competition.Magician can/will improve the performance of your SSD phenomenally, but install it and use it with care. Do these things first...1 - Read the manual. The quid-pro-quos of Do's and Do-NOT's take up two full pages.2 - With this in mind set up your BIOS/UEFI3 - Install the OS, any necessary/missing drivers for your mobo and hardware, and only the most important user software and anti-virus you NEED to run flawlessly on your new build.4 - Update EVERYTHING except KB3004394. Windows has pulled this update on all WIN7 and Server 2008 machines, but users it also conflicts with software on WIN8 machines. If you have this update installed, uninstall and HIDE it, or the Sorcerer will freeze your new build (Don't ask how I know this).5 - Back up any user data you cannot lose.6 - CREATE A RESTORE POINT!!! (Unless you find the words ""Refresh"" and ""Restore"" strangely comforting.)7 - Install Magician8 - Try out one feature at a time, TEST the feature, and create a RESTORE point after each successful feature.9 - Once you have a stable machine with the Magician features you like, install the rest of your software, create restore points, and enjoy the performance.Samsung Magician works flawlessly for most users, but if your UEFI, your Windows updates, your drivers, Magician options, or some other part of your configuration is not to Samsung's liking, you may experience a frozen OS, a frozen SSD and will need to resort to the previous configuration.OS optimization: only works on one drive. DO NOT apply it to more than one, or you will crash both Magician and the system.RAPID: is an excellent performance enhancement feature, but it does not play well with some IRST drivers (which perform some of the same enhancements as Samsung RAPID). Read the manual and install only compatible IRST drivers.Secure Data: has three modes, and only uses ONE mode! DO NOT activate more than one! Not only will Magician crash, it will crash your new build and you will need to revert to your Restore Point.Samsung is actively working on compatibility issues (esp with RAPID) and listens to the forums for feedback, but they have consistently had issues since 2011. Don't hold your breath.Install. Update. Backup. and Restore! The most lucky and persistent users are able to make Magician work for them, but if you have problems, you will spend time looking for technical answers on the forums. Good luck!
        ","
Pros:
                - SPEED!!! 2nd fastest SSD out there (and a close second only to the PRO series for a significant increase in price). Achieved roughly the advertised IOs without installing the Magician software.- Installation: stupidly simple on a clean installation. Just install the device in your build, set your UEFI/BIOS, install the OS, and viola! There is/are your drive(s) in all their blistering fast glory (WIN8.1 installs in less than 20 minutes if *you* are the bottleneck, and loads in 8 seconds without any fast-boot BIOS setup. If you are a photo editor, you won't have time to even sip your coffee).
            ","
Cons:
                SAMSUNG MAGICIAN DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS!!! It is the most finicky software I have installed on any machine in over 25 years! I almost subtracted three eggs for this (except the SSD performs flawlessly and admirably without it). If I could review the software alone, Magician would get only one egg!On the one hand, if Samsung Magician likes your build, not only will your SSD meet or match advertised and reviewed performance, it will exceed it by as much as 50% or more!On the other hand, if Samsung the Magician, feels slighted in the least by your configuration, it will become SAMSUNG THE SORCERER! and crash your machine. The very word ""Refresh"" will give you PTSD, and ""Restore"" will commit you to the institution.

The OS on the Samsung 850 EVO with two seagate HDD's in raid 0 (GPT) for storage only.  I keep getting this error during win7 installation ""no drives detected"" despite loading the AMD raid drivers during installation. I also tried this trick by booting and installing the RAID drivers from the eSATA controller while the internal controller is configured to Raid 0 with the array activated, after the Raid drivers are installed, I switched all drives to the internal controller. It crashes shortly after the Microsoft logo appears in a Raid environment. This tricks works perfectly with Scandisk SSD. I had the same issue with Crucial M500 SSD. I have read that some SSD's don't fully support AMD 990FX chipset.  I guess I will never be able to set up RAID in my new system until AMD releases improved drivers. Despite all that, I'm happy with my purchase because it is performing  super well in AHCI mode.

            I didn't use their data transfer software so I don't know how that is. I used Acronis True Image for this and was able to backup only my Windows and EFI partitions, then restore them to the new SSD. No issues.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my HP desktop machine has a 2.5"" drive mount so I didn't need an adapter kit. Nice!Samsung Magician software is very helpful but not really necessary if you don't use Windows. The real magic is in the drive, which would be recognized by any current operating system that supports SSD's. It helped me best configure Windows to maximize the performance of the drive. After turning on RAPID mode in Samsung Magician, the benchmark numbers went up but it was already amazingly fast.Logging into Windows though and not having to wait for the apps in the tray (antivirus, OneDrive, etc.) to get going (and hear the HDD chattering) while they do... Priceless. "" Oh look, they're loaded and ready to go.""  Smiles...

Pros:
                It's considerably fast compared to other SSDs I've looked at in benchmark tests. The speeds are almost on par with the benchmark test speeds. It's not the fastest SSD around, but it's by no means slow. Windoges 7 takes about 10-15 seconds to fully boot, and by boot I mean I can actually open up applications and not have to wait an additional minute for an application to fully load (like I did with my old hard drive). Samsung has a 5 year warranty on this drive. But, remember they also throw in a disclaimer saying that there's a maximum amount of data you can write before your warranty is void (this is expressed in TBW, or terabytes written). Look at Samsung's product page for this item and it should tell you the exact amount of TBW you can have before you void your warranty. I've looked at endurance tests for this type of SSD, in which this model SSD had lots of data written to it 24/7 until it died from being practically abused from the moment it was turned on. The results were pleasing: it far outlasts its warranty both time wise and TBW wise. If TBW was the only factor that contributed to how long an SSD lived, they found that the theoretical life of this drive was around 70 years for an average user. Note: the keyword is ""theoretical"" in my last sentence. Please do not buy this drive and take my own word for the life of this SSD; I advise you to do your own research before buying this SSD.

But the drive, as advertised, is great. Regarding the drive migration software, the only way you'll get it to work is if: 1) You are not booted from it 2) The drive you are copying from is less than 80% full. 3) the amount of data you are copying is less than 80% of the size of the SSD you are copying to.In short, you cannot clone a mostly full 250GB drive onto a 500GB SSD with the included cloning software. You cannot copy 420GB of actual data from a 1TB drive onto a 500GB drive with this software. And you cannot clone any boot drive onto the SSD unless you have already made a different boot drive from which to run the cloning operation. Seriously?

            So, I went from a Western Digital 7200 rpm 1 TB drive to a 1 TB SSD. I did not use the included data migration software. Instead I used a one to one hard drive cloning box. No problems at all after copying. Installed into my PC and was up and running with one error message but nothing serious, just a volume size difference thing quickly resolved by the OS. First boot was very fast. Installed the magician software and made a few tweaks and all was great. I must say that I was surprised at how well the software worked. As I said earlier I did not use the data migration software so I can't say how it works. Others have said it works well and I don't doubt it, It was just easier for me to clone the drive outside the PC.  As for performance it is noticeably faster. With that said, I guess I was so caught up in the hype that I expected lightning fast. Boot up is about a third of the time it used to be and that is great. However after boot up, I have not yet seen the blazing increase in speed in my machine.  Programs do open faster but my machine was pretty quick to begin with.  Please don't misunderstand, this is a very fast drive, my only question is was it worth 400 bucks for the increased boot speed. Only time will tell how much faster my system is after a few weeks of use.  Overall it is fast, stable and would recommend this drive to anyone thinking about an SSD.

Overall Review:
            It works amazingly well. There are some tutorials showing how to use the migration software. I bought the 1 Tb drive so I could just pick up all of my programs, data, OS etc and move it onto a better, faster drive. I was not disappointed. Step one. Back up you old HDD. Step two - run the migration software (it took me 4 hours to move 800G). Step three - power down and unplug the old HDD. Step four - reboot and run with the new drive. There might be some tweaking involved. The software that comes with this will help you with the OS settings. Also, I initially has issues launching games, but after a bit of homework I discovered that the nForce SATA controllers were frankly terrible for SSDs - which is not shocking since they weren't around when the drivers were written. Diablo 3 failed to load completely. I swapped in the standard  Microsoft drivers for the nForce ones (drill though system info to the device manager to the driver selection. click update then tell it you want to select the driver to use and pick the  Standard controller driver... kick nForce to the curb and problem solved). I'm not getting all the speed I would with a SATA III board. And I know there will likely be issues with the garbage function down the road so it might start slowing in a year or two. By then I plan on upgrading my system to a sweet i5 rig. Till then, this works great. I recommend it to anyone.
        ","
Pros:
                It is small, light and takes up no room to speak of.The migration software is dead-simple.Tuning software is wonderful and easy to use.The connections are well-made.It works fine with SATA IIIt is very fast - blazing fast compared to a standard HDD - even with only SATA II.It's the single, simplest upgrade you can give an older system.
            ","
Cons:
                It takes a bit of tweaking to get all of the functionality with an older motherboard like mine.You have to do a bit of research to discover the issues with nForce drivers, but that's not something that I would take an egg off. With a newer mobo or a fresh install this is probably a breeze to use.

Pros:
                So I purchased this SSD for my Alienware M14X R2. About two years ago I upgraded the HDD to a Crucial M4 512Gb (512Gb because I games and wanted to install a lot of games). However I put that SSD in my gaming desktop, and for the past year I have been using the regular HDD that came with the laptop. For anyone who knows about a HDD and an SSD, it's night and day. With the HDD, it took 3 minutes to boot, and FOREVER to open up files and such (I use the laptop mainly for school). So my main reason for getting this SSD was for faster boot, and faster loading and bringing up files.I also only got the 250GB version because I only use the laptop for school, and very little gaming for on the go.
            ","
Cons:
                I only jumped on it because it's only been out a few months, meaning they are fairly new, and up to date in the technology world. I was thinking I got such a good deal when I paid $128.99 after taxes. About 3 days of it being delivered, another online retailer dropped it to $109.99, meaning it would be $119.99 after taxes. So I paid about $10 more, but no worries because newegg is tied (in my personal opinion) with that other company. Too bad they don't price match it.

2164,Excellent drive but using the encryption is tricky!,"
Overall Review:
            This drive is special because it has a feature called SED (self encrypting drive) it is ALWAYS encrypting your data with encryption keys that it stores in its ROM.  If you use software to delete the keys the info is useless so no need to do a government style drive wipe that reduces SSDs lifespans.The thing is that SED feature wasn't made for that.  It was made so that if your laptop or even desktop got in the wrong hands the data would be useless.There is no mention of HOW to setup the drive to do this.  Utilizing this feature means storing the encryption keys outside the drive and send the drive the key every time you start the computer.  NO KEY NO DATA!Well very few consumer boards (some asrock) can set an SED HD password in bios.  The bios holds the keys and when you type a boot password it transmits the keys to your SSD unlocking the data.You probably don't have that board soOption 2If you buy a version of windows or upgrade to one that has bitlocker bitlocker has a feature that can speak to the SED SSD.You must install windows using UEFI.  There are many advantages to installing in UEFI mode so I would recommend you do this no matter what!If installed using UEFI use a guide to bitlocker to encrypt your drive.  Use a USB thumb drive to store your keys and back them up somewhere else and put them in a safe or something.If you do things correctly bitlocker WILL NOT inform you that it has to take time to encrypt the data in your drive.  If bitlocker tells you this you are doing software encryption which is not as secure and it is slower.Google bitlocker SED for more info

Cons:
                absolutely no guide or help on how to utilize the encryption (SED) that is already happening to secure your computer.To secure erase the drive you must run software from a bootable USB or CD and usually you have to unplug a running drive and plug it back in while the software is running.

            i used the clone software to pull my windows drive over to the ssd and started as normal but my boot times were at 22+ seconds. my crucial mx100 512gb had this beat so i figured... hmm, i have the day off, lets just reformat. yup. definitely better in my experience to do a fresh format. the startup dropped 8 seconds. much better.
        ","
Pros:
                super fast startup at 14sec to desktop and about 18 with all things loaded like trillian, dropbox, onedrive, afterburner, utorrent, etc. just amazing. photoshop, waterfox, others start instantly. nothing else can really be said.

Cannot be raided as a system OS drive which is the reason I purchased 2 of them.  ASUS support is clueless and Samsung support for SSD drives appears non existent, sadly I'll be returning 2 of the 3 drives and eating neweggs wonderful restocking fees.

2171,Not magically fast,"
Overall Review:
            This is my first Samsung SSD and the reason I bought it was all the hype.  I don’t know, maybe it’s just me but I’m not terribly impressed by the 850 Evo.  It might be the light, plastic feel when I picked it up.  I’m just not sure but it’s not doing anything for me.  It’s possible I’m just becoming blasé at SSDs.  They don’t hold the technological mystery they once did.  They’re becoming utilitarian like mice or keyboards or hard drives.
        ","
Pros:
                I’m  replacing a 120G Corsair Neutron GTX that’s a little over a year old.  It’s installed in my production machine that has an ASUS Maximus GeneVII motherboard and a Haswell i5 processor.  I use this machine every day for standard chores including a lot of downloading, Internet Surfing and burning tons of BluRay discs.  It has 8 gigs of memory and uses the built in Intel graphics.  The Corsair SSD was always lightening quick and  dead reliable.  It really didn’t need replacing because I store everything on a 3 Gig hard drive.  But I guess I just wanted to see what the hype was with the Samsung drives.To be honest the Samsung seems no faster or more responsive then the Neutron.  It’s quick for sure but not… magically fast.  The experience is exactly the same.  I will give the Samsung Magician software my highest praise for doing everything you might ever need or think you need.  Rapid Mode didn’t seem to make any difference in speed and adds approximately ten seconds to the boot time.  The OS Optimization section contains almost every OS trick you’d ever want to know and of course there is an included TRIM applet.  Very complete and very user friendly and included with the drive on one of those miniature discs.It has a 5 year warranty which is better than most SSDs although this is new technology and who knows how it will fare a few years from now.
            ","
Cons:
                It’s certainly fast but not enough of a performance jump to necessitate upgrading from any recent performance SSD.  The drive is bare bones and all that’s included is the Magician software disc.  Does not have a quality feel to it but this is a subjective appraisal on my part.  It’s expensive or at least in comparison to other drives of the same performance tier.

Great, inexpensive upgrade that flies (e.g. boots Win 8.1 in 5 seconds, programs load and run instantaneously. Samsung data migration does not copy the manufactuer's backup / recovery file (e.g. may be a legal thing as Samsung makes PCs too). Made a USB thumb drive backup / recovery  image before doing the clone.When I first turned on the new laptop, there were more 65  important Windows updates to install. Also deleted all the bloatware. Hint: Use the Windows clean disk utility to delete the huge amount of unneeded files and then do a HDD defrag before cloning to the SSD.

It's going to change a lot of things in the computing world if it's what I read about I have only owned this drives for a short while and have not been able to confirm if it's what I believe/hope it is.

Overall Review:
            The case feels a little cheap to me. Like a cheap tin can. but then, at this price point and their amazing performance, sacrifices had to be made somewhere. Not a big deal as you just put it in the Drive tray and forget it.

Cons:
                Cannot be set in raid on AMD SB950. The drive is detected fine in RAID op ROM. I can set up a raid array fine. Bios sees my raid array fine too. But come windows installation, this ssd will not be found even after loading raid drivers. It must be something about its firmware (which there are no updates to) because my Intel ssd, chronos deluxe ssd and all of my old spinner hdds detect fine in raid. Even with already installed windows in raid on my other drives, Samsung SSDs can't be detected by windows. (and yes, I've updated all my drivers and firmware and all that). When I switch my Mobo back to AHCI, SSDs show up right away. But now you can't have raid. I Just wanted to warn you guys before you spend 900 dollars on couple of these thinking how sick it would be to RAID-0 these bad boys.    Yea, I tried...Nope!

Pros:
                I've been using an Intel 330 120GB for the last 2 years. I'm extremely satisfied but I was looking for more storage. Was hesitating between the Intel 730 480GB and this SSD. Benchmark were giving a good lead to the Samsung 850 EVO. I was worried about samsung quality versus intel but all my fear are now gone.-Extremely fast (consistant 500mb/s read/write)-High endurance (150GB per days for 5 years vs 75GB for the Intel 730 or 20GB for my old Intel 330)-Good price (.50$/GB)-Amazing software (Samsung magician is extremely useful and provide a lot more tools than the Intel SSD Toolbox)-Presentation (drive came in a nice little box and the ssd itself is good looking)

                Extremely fast and high performance, exactly what I expected from a Samsung SSD product. I've purchased well over 10 Samsung SSDs and I was interested in the 850 EVO right when it came out. None of the local stores had the brand new 850 EVO, NewEgg had the latest and newest product right away. This SSD replaced the 500GB internal HDD in my workstation laptop. (Purchased 500GB because the original one in the laptop was also 500GB).

Cons:
                Samsung Data Migration software is fantastic. Unfortunately, I had a little software hiccup with this particular transition. At first boot, received a boot error. Easy fix by loading the Win7 OS and using the Repair option. Otherwise - 850 EVO is amazing.

Cons:
                Expensive : Although i love this drive in fact i just bought another one for my girlfriends laptop. The $250 price tag for 500GB still makes the inner techie in me ask if the faster boot up times and quicker load times in games worth paying nearly 5 times the cost per MB?Small : I am kind of a hoarder, my computer collects a  lot of games, applications, videos. This is also compounded by the fact that i also stream/record and video edit to post on YouTube. Size becomes a huge problem and even the 1TB SSD are simply to small if you like to hold on to a lot of games/applications/databases/video files.

While completely thrilled at how fast it saves video to the drive,  I am floored that it plugged into this old SATA2 board, it's crazy fast. Knowing that when I upgrade, this drive will only get faster, simply amazed me. It used to encode in the background after I walked away. Now, I may as well just stay here and wait.

None of the hardware shown in the installation pictures is included with this drive. I suspect it is old documentation that was printed back when SSDs still shipped with things like mounting screws, 2.5"" to 3.5"" mounting brackets, SATA cable, and a USB to SATA adapter. It's all shown in the pretty installation pictures, but NONE of that stuff is included in the box. Nor does it mention anywhere how to enable TRIM which by the way was NOT enabled by default after I migrated my data over.

2224,Alien Speed SSD,"
Overall Review:
            I just picked this up today and put this in my rig. I am currently running an i7 5820k w/ 16gb of 2666mhz ddr4. The only reason I list those specs is because of the rapid mode on this ssd. I currently have rapid mode and performance mode enabled. This uses 4gb of system ram now or 25% depending on which is lower for your build. With it set like this on this build I am getting 5674mb/s read and 5431mb/s write speeds. I was simply blown away by this as pcie ssds get 2000mb/s. This is simply a ton of bang for your buck if you have the money to spend on it.

Overall Review:
            I upgraded to the 850EVO after using a Crucial M500 for the last couple of years and the speed difference is blinding!  Samsung's toolset for the SSD is excellent and includes everything you'd need for a smooth transition

Pros:
                Great drive, initially bought it to upgrade a 240GB 840 Pro, but decided to throw it in my G75VW and swap out the 120GB Intel 520.I was surprised by the benchmark scores, this drives performance is great. Also, the data migration and Magician software were really helpful in getting the files moved and optimizing the drive.
            ","
Cons:
                Drive is loud on start-up, it usually settles out after I hit the desktop. However I never had that happen with the Intel 520, and the 840 Pro is in a desktop, so I've never really noticed.Don't know if that's a ""thing"" with these drives or not, but I'm hoping it doesn't develop into a problem in the future.

Pros:
                only 152 dollars shipped after tax, quick delivery, the ssd has very fast speeds overall, most surprisingly was the 4k QD 1 read speeds which i normally look at before buying an ssd, i tested it using AS SSD with 211 GB free with rapid enabled and was able to hit about 54 MB/s, the only other ssd i saw that hit around that speed for qd1 was intel's dc p3700 drives but they are extremely expensive per GB. my system does have a lot of tweaks and optimizations so the benchmark numbers will vary depending on your particular setup. overall, im very happy with this purchase.
